      "Tag: p7, Text: A young Tuktamysheva had prevailed at Russian Championships at the end of the noughties, particularly in the ladies singles. She was labelled the child prodigy of figure skating, since she had come to the sport relatively late, at the age of nine, and by the time she was 12, she was already performing extremely difficult elements, having mastered the whole arsenal of triple jumps. It was thanks to these that she earned a reputation as the most “leaping” female figure skater., Level: 2\n",

In terms of technique, she has already beaten all the adult champions. Recently, a video of her demonstration program was reposted by Hollywood actress Sharon Stone., Level: 2\n",

      "Tag: p2, Text: “[Katya] was so tiny, small even for her young age,” her first local coach stated. “I took a closer look at her. This girl was amazing right from the start. She was so swift… and absolutely fearless.” It thus comes as no surprise she began competing at 11 itself, only to then find herself pairing up with Vladislav Lysoy and Aleksandr Epifanov before finding a long-term partner in Harley Windsor. The truth is they’d met in December 2015 for a tryout, but it was evident there was magic between the duo the moment they stepped foot into the rink together thanks to their similar techniques., Level: 3\n",
      "Tag: p4, Text: Hence came Katya’s release by Russia upon the Australian Association’s request, a move down under, expedited citizenship, and countless training sessions to ensure the pair could debut in 2016. Their first Junior Grand Prix (JGP) in the Czech Republic wasn’t really great, yet they returned with a bang for the Estonia event less than a month later, meaning they earned gold medals. Then came the duo’s 2017 Junior World Championship, 2018 Junior Grand Prix Win, and 2018 Winter Olympics participation, just for them to end up ranking 18 before deciding to change coaches., Level: 3\n",
      "Tag: p7, Text: Katya was thus medically ordered to step away from her love of skating for good, as a result of which her partnership with Harley also came to a mutual end and she found herself isolated, per the movie. Alas, it all got too much for the 20-year-old and she jumped from the 6th-floor window of her Moscow home on July 18, 2020 — she died by suicide, leaving behind a mere note reading “Lyublyu” (Rough Translation: I love)., Level: 3\n",

      "Tag: p8, Text: Gordeeva and Grinkov, who represented the Soviet Union, have an illustrious competitive legacy, winning four world titles (1986, 1987, 1989, 1990) and 1988 Olympic gold before turning professional in late 1990. The couple regained their Olympic eligibility for the 1993-1994 season and won a second Olympic title, that time competing for Russia., Level: 3\n",

It didn’t seem like it was making any noise over the ice. With Katia, she was always sort of floating above the ice, and they sort of meshed [with] each other. There was no heaviness to their skating, it was beautiful and light.”, Level: 3\n",

Swift) in 1996 about her life with her first husband, “My Sergei,” and enjoyed a decades-long performing career. But in 1995 her professional future, and earning power, was uncertain., Level: 3\n",
      "Tag: p31, Text: “All of Katia and Sergei was a love story,” Zoueva said. “They started skating (together) when they were around 11 and 14. First, they were very friendly like brother and sister, then they fell in love, then they were married and had a baby. It was always about their love… Sergei was very, very happy. Always laughing, had lots of friends, loved to skate, loved to perform, loved Katia and loved his daughter. There was a lot of love.”, Level: 3\n",
      "Tag: p33, Text: “There is a memorial plaque with several pictures of Katia and Sergei that sits on the wall steps from my office, which is a daily reminder of Sergei,” Wylie said. “Whenever I go to the USA rink, which is where Sergei passed away, I go to the blue line to the right of entrance and I think about that moment. And whenever I stand where the Zamboni comes on, I remember when Elena Bechke ran in and said, ‘Oh my gosh, Sergei fell down.’ It was one of those moments where your life just changes.”, Level: 3\n",

The first time figure skating was held as an Olympic competition was during the 1908 Summer <a>Olympic Games</a> (London), which was also the first and only time a special figures contest was held. With his gold-medal win in this special figures category, Russian figure skater Nikolai Panin became the first Russian to win an Olympic gold medal.</p>\\n<p>Russian figures skaters in men\\'s\\xa0singles competitions have continued to bring glory to Russia up to the present day. The World Figure Skating Championships, for example, were dominated by Russian male skaters in the late \\'90s and early 2000s. From 1998 to 2004, it was a Russian who took the gold -\\xa0<a>Alexei Yagudin</a>, 1998 to 2000 and 2002; <a>Evgeni Plushenko</a>, 2001, 2003, and 2004.</p>\\n<p>This list contains the best skaters in Russian history. These are the men who have inspired newcomers to the sport and drawn audiences to figure skating competitions.

She was labelled the child prodigy of figure skating, since she had come to the sport relatively late, at the age of nine, and by the time she was 12, she was already performing extremely difficult elements, having mastered the whole arsenal of triple jumps. It was thanks to these that she earned a reputation as the most “leaping” female figure skater.</p7><p8>“I trained in the old school. I started skating and winning in major league sports very early. This was 2009-2010, when there had been a decline in Russian ladies’ singles skating and you just needed to know how to jump. If you could jump, you would win. That’s the way it turned out ever since I was young. I jumped and won. It was normal. It was how the system worked,” she <a>recounted</a>.</p8><p9>In 2018-2019, she was arguably the most talked about figure skater in the world, after her bewitching performance in a flight attendant’s costume to the accompaniment of Britney Spears’ Toxic in the Grand Prix Series. Accusations that she had “crossed the line” rained down on Tuktamysheva then, to which she just retorted: “I’m just putting the sexiness back into figure skating.”</p9><p13>She is talked about as the main record-setter in Russian figure skating. Trusova was the first female figure skater in history to perform three quads in a single program. In terms of technique, she has already beaten all the adult champions. Recently, a video of her demonstration program was reposted by Hollywood actress Sharon Stone.</p13><p14>The young skater herself admits that only two things in life leave her exhilarated - skating and her dogs (Tina the chihuahua, Lana the poodle and Jack the husky). She has been managed by Evgeni Plushenko since 2020 - and lives in a cottage attached to his academy, so as not to waste time on travel.</p14></div3><div4><a>\\n                    sport\\n                </a><a>\\n                    figure skating\\n                </a></div4></div1></html1>\\n<div0>\\n<span>\\n<a>Home</a>\\n<a>/ Lifestyle</a>\\n<a>/ People</a>\\n</span>\\n<h1>Figure skating legends inspire youth at Olympic Day event</h1>\\n<span>\\n          By China Daily | \\n          chinadaily.com.cn |\\n          Updated: 2024-06-24 15:22\\n</span>\\n<span>Share</span>\\n<span>Share - WeChat</span>\\n<span>CLOSE</span>\\n<div>\\n<div>\\n<figcaption>\\n   Former Team China figure skater Tong Jian guides students to grasp skating skills on Sunday.\\xa0[Photo provided to China Daily] \\n </figcaption>\\n<p>A figure skating public welfare class, held at the National Speed Skating Oval on Sunday to commemorate Olympic Day, became a platform for inspiration and skill-building for young enthusiasts.</p>\\n<p>Former Team China figure skater Tong Jian, a two-time world champion in figure skating pairs alongside his partner Pang Qing, and Russian international coach Andrei Lazukin, took the lead in guiding the eager students through ice skating exercises.

This girl was amazing right from the start. She was so swift… and absolutely fearless.” It thus comes as no surprise she began competing at 11 itself, only to then find herself pairing up with Vladislav Lysoy and Aleksandr Epifanov before finding a long-term partner in Harley Windsor. The truth is they’d met in December 2015 for a tryout, but it was evident there was magic between the duo the moment they stepped foot into the rink together thanks to their similar techniques.</p2>\\n<p4>Hence came Katya’s release by Russia upon the Australian Association’s request, a move down under, expedited citizenship, and countless training sessions to ensure the pair could debut in 2016. Their first Junior Grand Prix (JGP) in the Czech Republic wasn’t really great, yet they returned with a bang for the Estonia event less than a month later, meaning they earned gold medals. Then came the duo’s 2017 Junior World Championship, 2018 Junior Grand Prix Win, and 2018 Winter Olympics participation, just for them to end up ranking 18 before deciding to change coaches.</p4>\\n<p7>Katya was thus medically ordered to step away from her love of skating for good, as a result of which her partnership with Harley also came to a mutual end and she found herself isolated, per the movie. Alas, it all got too much for the 20-year-old and she jumped from the 6th-floor window of her Moscow home on July 18, 2020 — she died by suicide, leaving behind a mere note reading “Lyublyu” (Rough Translation: I love).</p7>\\n</div>\\n</div0>\\n</html3>\\n<html4>\\n<title>List of Russian champions in figure skating – Pairs - FamousFix List</title>\\n<div>\\n<div>\\n<div>\\n<h1>Russian champions in figure skating – Pairs</h1>\\r\\nThis list has <i>28 members</i>.\\r\\n</div>\\n<div>\\r\\nFLAG\\r\\n</div>\\n<span>\\r\\nLike \\n</span>\\n</div>\\n<ul>\\n<div0>\\n<div>\\n<a>Ekaterina Gordeeva</a>\\n<span>Russian pair skater</span>\\n</div>\\n<span>\\n<span>\\n\\xa0<span>0</span>\\n</span>\\n<span>\\n\\xa0<span>0</span>\\n</span>\\n</span>\\n<div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trank <b>#1</b> ·\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<span>WDW</span>\\n<span>36 </span>\\n<span>3 </span>\\n<span>2 </span>\\n</div>\\n<div>Ekaterina \"Katia\" Alexandrovna Gordeeva (Russian: Екатерина Александровна Гордеева; born 28 May 1971) is a Russian former figure skater.

The couple regained their Olympic eligibility for the 1993-1994 season and won a second Olympic title, that time competing for Russia.</p8><p13>“It was the quality they brought,” Hamilton added. “They were Olympic champions, and Katia was sort of the <b>Nadia [Comăneci]</b> of the 1988 Games. She was so young (16) and beautiful, or adorable rather than beautiful. She captivated a lot of people. It was really fascinating [because] at that time the Soviet Union was a mystery to a lot of people.”</p13><p15>“Sergei had the look, the line, the quality, and he had great feet in lifts,” Hamilton said. “He was a very strong and big man (about 6 feet, 175 pounds), but he skated with this effortless power. It didn’t seem like it was making any noise over the ice. With Katia, she was always sort of floating above the ice, and they sort of meshed [with] each other. There was no heaviness to their skating, it was beautiful and light.”</p15><p17><b>Elena Bechke</b>, the 1992 Olympic silver medalist with <b>Denis Petrov</b>, grew up in the Soviet Union and competed against Gordeeva and Grinkov while skating with an earlier partner. She and Petrov performed with Stars on Ice for many years, and were present in Lake Placid when Grinkov died.</p17><p23>“They were very light, like (three-time world champion) <b>Patrick Chan</b>,” she said. “That is the difference. (Chan) skates like a feather, flowing on the ice. It’s the same talent Katia and Sergei had. They had natural rhythm; that’s why their pair elements were perfect. They had natural harmony… I saw this, and I emphasized this in the choreography I did for them: the lightness, the connection, how they looked at each other, the bodylines.”</p23><p27>“Celebration of a Life” marked Gordeeva’s debut as a singles skater, in programs choreographed by Zoueva to Tchaikovsky’s “Serenade for Strings” and Mahler’s “Adagietto.” Just 24 when Grinkov died, the skater wrote a bestseller (with E.M. Swift) in 1996 about her life with her first husband, “My Sergei,” and enjoyed a decades-long performing career. But in 1995 her professional future, and earning power, was uncertain.</p27><p31>“All of Katia and Sergei was a love story,” Zoueva said. “They started skating (together) when they were around 11 and 14. First, they were very friendly like brother and sister, then they fell in love, then they were married and had a baby. It was always about their love… Sergei was very, very happy. Always laughing, had lots of friends, loved to skate, loved to perform, loved Katia and loved his daughter. There was a lot of love.”</p31><p33>“There is a memorial plaque with several pictures of Katia and Sergei that sits on the wall steps from my office, which is a daily reminder of Sergei,” Wylie said. “Whenever I go to the USA rink, which is where Sergei passed away, I go to the blue line to the right of entrance and I think about that moment. And whenever I stand where the Zamboni comes on, I remember when Elena Bechke ran in and said, ‘Oh my gosh, Sergei fell down.’ It was one of those moments where your life just changes.”</p33>\\n</div1>\\n</div0>\\n</div>\\n<html6><title>Meet Kamila Valieva, Olympic Champion 2022 in figure skating in team classification (PHOTOS) - Russia Beyond</title><div1><div0><h1>Meet Kamila Valieva, Olympic Champion 2022 in figure skating in team classification (PHOTOS)</h1><a>\\n            Lifestyle\\n        </a><time>\\n             Feb 08 2022\\n        </time><a>\\n                    Victoria Ryabikova\\n                </a></div0><div3><p0>After the Russian figure skating team won a gold medal, the awarding ceremony scheduled for February 7 was postponed because of unclear reasons.

Russian figure skaters are trained to operate like athletic machines before they\\'re old enough to attend kindergarten.\\xa0</p><p>While their methods are questionable, Russia\\'s churned out many memorable figure skating champions. Which ones <em>were</em> the most memorable? Here are the most popular to date.</p></section0><section1><h2>Sergei Ponomarenko</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> Oct. 6, 1960</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> Olympic Champion, three-time World Champion</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Sergei Ponomarenko and his skating partner and wife Marina Klimova made waves during the 1980s and \\'90s as ice dancers. They won four European titles in a row, and they had one of the longest careers at the time, spanning over a decade. Ponomarenko was one of the oldest skating champions, delaying retirement until he was in his early 30s.</p><p>Following retirement, he and Klimova were both inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame, and Ponomarenko remains an ISU technical specialist for Russia. Both of them now coach in San Jose, California, and one of their sons, Anthony Ponomarenko, is now a competitive ice dancer.\\xa0</p></section1><section2><h2>Ilia Kulik</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> May 23, 1977</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> First figure skater to win Olympic gold with a quadruple jump</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Ilia Kulik was 20 when he won a gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. He was only the second man in the sport\\'s history to win gold on his first try. He started skating at 5 and was initially more on the clumsy side. But his coach noted Kulik\\'s refusal to give up and encouraged him to continue lessons.</p><p>Kulik went on to win two Russian national championships, followed by a stunning Olympic debut with one of the most challenging programs ever successfully skated at that time. It included a quadruple toe loop and eight triples. Later in life, he became a distinguished choreographer, touring with both \"Champions on Ice\" and \"Stars on Ice.\"\\xa0</p></section2><section3><h2>Adelina Sotnikova</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> July 1, 1996</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> Four-time Russian National Champion</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Adelina Sotnikova isn\\'t the most famous Russian figure skater, but she had a loyal fanbase throughout the 2010s. She started skating when she was just 4 at a rink near her home in Moscow. Just eight years later, she won gold at the senior-level Russian Nationals.</p><p>She was too young to compete on the Junior Grand Prix circuit that season, but she continued working her way up, eventually winning Olympic gold in 2014. She had a string of lingering injuries, eventually retiring due to chronic pain.\\xa0</p><strong>RELATED: Meet Ilia Malinin, the \\'Quad God\\' of Figure Skating</strong></section3><section4><h2>Alexei Yagudin</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> March 18, 1980</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Saint Petersburg, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> Only skater to have achieved a Golden Slam</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> One of the most memorable Russian figure skaters of all time, Alexei Yagudin is the only skater to have won a Golden Slam – a victory in every major figure skating championship in the same season. This includes the Olympics, World Championships, European Championships, Grand Prix assignments and Grand Prix final. He was primed for success from the start, landing all his double jumps by age 10 and five triples before the age of 12.\\xa0</p><p>He was awarded the Order of Merit by the Russian Federation in 2003 and joined the figure skating Hall of Fame in 2017. Since then, he\\'s worked as an actor, TV host and sports commentator.</p></section4><section5><h2>Irina Slutskaya</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> Feb. 9, 1979</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> Two-time World Champion</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Irina Slutskaya had a rocky road in figure skating, but her athleticism and innovation set her performances apart from the rest. After initial success in the sport, she hit a plateau in her skating career, failing to qualify for both the European and World championships. Instead of throwing in the towel, she continued training.\\xa0</p><p>It\\'s a good thing she did because she went on to beat Michelle Kwan at the 2000 Grand Prix Final, plus won a silver medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. She actually tied for gold, but Sara Hughes of the U.S. took the gold in a tiebreaker free skate.</p><p>Slutskaya was known for her power on the ice, making history as the first woman to land a triple-Lutz-triple-loop combination. She was also known for her signature double Biellmann spin, which she made up herself.\\xa0</p></section5><section6><h2>Alexandra Trusova</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> June 23, 2004</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Ryazan, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> First female to land two quads in a free skate</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Alexandra Trusova is one of Russia\\'s favorite figure skaters at the moment. She was the Beijing 2022 Olympic silver medalist, and quads are her claim to fame. She\\'s the first female to land the quad Lutz, flip and toe loop jumps in competition and was the first to land two, then three quads in a free skate.\\xa0</p><p>She has three Grand Prix Champion titles under her belt, and she\\'s expected to continue on her quad-packed career path at the next Olympic games.</p></section6><section8><h2>Anna Shcherbakova</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> March 28, 2004</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> First woman to land a quad Lutz in competition</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Anna Scherbakova is still young, and she\\'s one of the most promising Russian figure skaters in competition. She was the second figure skater to perform two quadruple Lutz jumps in one program, following American skater Nathan Chen. She\\'s also the first to land a quad flip in combination with a triple.\\xa0</p><p>She gets her inspiration from retired Japanese figure skater Mao Asada, and she loves caring for her pets in her limited free time, including a dog named Sandy, a street cat named Mafia and a Maine coon cat named Shiny.</p><p><strong>RELATED: 32 Best Male Figure Skaters of All Time, Ranked</strong>\\xa0</p></section8><section9><h2>Evgeni Plushenko</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> Nov. 3, 1982</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Dzhamku, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> Earned four Olympic medals</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> If you haven\\'t heard the name Plushenko, you\\'re probably not a figure skating fan. Plushenko was one of the biggest names in figure skating in the early 2000s, dominating the competition between 2003 and 2006. He was trying quads before it was popular, but his artistry was what made him so memorable.\\xa0</p><p>Despite several injuries, including a back injury resulting in surgery, he continued competing all the way up until 2014. He was crowned European champion for the seventh time in 2012 and won a fourth Olympic medal at the Sochi winter games in 2014.</p></section9><section10><h2>Kamila Valieva</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> April 26, 2006</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Kazan, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> First woman to land a quad at the Olympics\\xa0</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Kamila Valieva is one of five Russian figure skaters coached by Eteri Tutberidze at the same rink. That means she trains alongside Alexandra Trusova and Anna Shcherbakova. She started skating when she was only 3 and trains off the ice in ballet. She\\'s best known for her artistry, inspired by her love of painting. Many of her programs are inspired by famous works of art.\\xa0</p><p>In 2022, she became the center of an unfortunate doping scandal. She tested positive for a banned heart medication that\\'s known to help improve cardiovascular endurance. She was denied her gold medal in the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships due to the positive drug test and is currently suspended.</p><p>Make no mistake, however. She was only 15 at the time of the scandal, and her exclusion from the sport is tragic. The adults, including her coaches and parents, are the ones to blame, not the teenager.\\xa0</p></section10><section11><h2>Yulia Lipnitskaya</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> June 5, 1998</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Yekaterinburg, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> 2014 European champion</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Ready to be impressed? Yulia Lipnitskaya didn\\'t fall a single time during the 2011-2012 season. Skating through multiple competitions without a single fall is almost unheard of. The Russian skater adores competition, and her intense training was almost entirely self-motivated.</p><p>She even competed with a twisted ankle and ended up winning first in the short program and third in the free skate. She was the youngest woman figure skater to win Olympic gold under modern rules, at only 15 years, 249 days, and she was the youngest gold medalist at the European Championships in the ladies\\' singles category. Sadly, she retired in 2017 due to injuries and a battle with an eating disorder.</p><strong>RELATED: Why Don’t We Ever See Black Figure Skaters?</strong></section11><section12><h2>Alina Zagitova</h2><figcaption>\\\\</figcaption><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> May 18, 2002</p><p><strong>Birthplace:\\xa0</strong>Izhevsk, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:\\xa0</strong>2018 Olympic Champion, World Champion</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Alina Zagitova was ranked as the best female skater in the world in the 2018-2019 season, with countless titles and medals under her name. She is the only Russian female figure skater to win gold at the Olympics, World Figure Skating Champtionships, European Championships and Grand Prix Final, and she\\'s the first Muslim athlete to win an Olympic gold, a world title and a Super Slam.\\xa0</p><p>She also broke the world record under the old system once as well as four times under the new system. She got an early start, beginning formal lessons when she was 4 at the rink her father worked at as a hockey coach.

He began training at the Children and Youth Sports School in Moscow, but he wasn\\'t a strong solo skater. His coach opted to give him a shot in pairs skating, and he teamed up with 11-year-old skater Ekaterina Gordeeva when he was 14. They won the Junior World Championship in 1985, followed by a string of gold medals at the European Championships, World Championships and Olympic Games.\\xa0</p><p>Tragically, Grinkov collapsed during practice in Lake Placid, New York, in 1995, dying of a massive heart attack.

She started skating when she was only 4 and initially had to wear several pairs of socks because the smallest available pair of skates were still too big. When she teamed up with Grinkov, their chemistry was instant. Their coach once tried to get her to team up with a new partner after Grinkov was repeatedly late, but she was adamant that he was the only one for her. Instead of switching partners, they switched coaches.\\xa0</p><p>The pair went on to win almost every competition they entered. Out of 31 competitions, they finished first 24 times and never placed lower than second. After Grinkov passed away, Gordeeva remarried another famous Russian figure skater on this list, Ilia Kulik.

In 1985 they proved the critics wrong by capturing the junior world championship pairs title. The following year they went on to claim the first of four world championships (1986–87 and 1989–90) and were described as lithesome and creative, mature and strong. Their career peaked when they won their first Olympic gold medal with a unanimous vote at the <a>1988 Winter Games</a> in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, but it took a surprising turn in 1990 when, claiming their competitive drive had diminished, they retired as world champions.</p1><p2>During what turned out to be a <a>hiatus</a>, the pair married in April 1991. Thanks to rule changes in amateur skating, they were able to return to Olympic competition in <a>1994 at Lillehammer</a>, Norway, where they won a second gold medal despite a few minor errors in their routine. Afterward they immigrated to the <a>United States</a> to skate professionally. Their partnership ended abruptly in November 1995 when Grinkov died of a <a>heart attack</a> while practicing a routine. Gordeeva subsequently pursued a singles skating career. She entered professional skating competitions and appeared on television in skating-themed specials. She also toured with <a>Stars on Ice</a>, the professional skating company cofounded by Olympic gold medalist <a>Scott Hamilton</a>. She coauthored (with E.M.

This work identifies vulnerabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to noisy image attacks due to the lack of noise augmentation during training. It introduces Robust-VLGuard, a dataset to enhance robustness against Gaussian noise, and proposes DiffPure-VLM, a defense leveraging diffusion models to transform adversarial noise into Gaussian noise. The dataset and code will be open-sourced to advance secure VLM research.\n",

The first time figure skating was held as an Olympic competition was during the 1908 Summer  Olympic Games  (London), which was also the first and only time a special figures contest was held. With his gold-medal win in this special figures category, Russian figure skater Nikolai Panin became the first Russian to win an Olympic gold medal. </p> <p>  Russian figures skaters in men's singles competitions have continued to bring glory to Russia up to the present day. The World Figure Skating Championships, for example, were dominated by Russian male skaters in the late '90s and early 2000s. From 1998 to 2004, it was a Russian who took the gold -  Alexei Yagudin  , 1998 to 2000 and 2002;  Evgeni Plushenko  , 2001, 2003, and 2004. </p> <p>  This list contains the best skaters in Russian history.

(PHOTOS + VIDEO) </h1> Lifestyle March 30 2021 Yekaterina Sinelschikova For the first time in history, Russian figure skaters occupied the entire winners podium at the 2021 World Figure Skating Championships in the ladies’ singles in Stockholm. Previously, only American women skaters had managed the same feat, back in 1991! Anna Shcherbakova - Gold medalist <p>  Anna Shcherbakova of Russia competes in Women's Free Skating during the ISU World Figure Skating Championships on March 26, 2021 in Stockholm </p> Joel Marklund/Keystone Press Agency/Global Look Press Elizaveta Tuktamysheva - Silver medalist A young Tuktamysheva had prevailed at Russian Championships at the end of the noughties, particularly in the ladies singles. She was labelled the child prodigy of figure skating, since she had come to the sport relatively late, at the age of nine, and by the time she was 12, she was already performing extremely difficult elements, having mastered the whole arsenal of triple jumps. It was thanks to these that she earned a reputation as the most “leaping” female figure skater. “I trained in the old school. I started skating and winning in major league sports very early. This was 2009-2010, when there had been a decline in Russian ladies’ singles skating and you just needed to know how to jump. If you could jump, you would win. That’s the way it turned out ever since I was young. I jumped and won. It was normal. It was how the system worked,” she recounted . In 2018-2019, she was arguably the most talked about figure skater in the world, after her bewitching performance in a flight attendant’s costume to the accompaniment of Britney Spears’ Toxic in the Grand Prix Series. Accusations that she had “crossed the line” rained down on Tuktamysheva then, to which she just retorted: “I’m just putting the sexiness back into figure skating.” She is talked about as the main record-setter in Russian figure skating. Trusova was the first female figure skater in history to perform three quads in a single program. In terms of technique, she has already beaten all the adult champions. Recently, a video of her demonstration program was reposted by Hollywood actress Sharon Stone. The young skater herself admits that only two things in life leave her exhilarated - skating and her dogs (Tina the chihuahua, Lana the poodle and Jack the husky). She has been managed by Evgeni Plushenko since 2020 - and lives in a cottage attached to his academy, so as not to waste time on travel. sport figure skating</html1>Home/ Lifestyle/ People<h1> Figure skating legends inspire youth at Olympic Day event</h1>By China Daily |           chinadaily.com.cn |          Updated: 2024-06-24 15:22ShareShare - WeChatCLOSEFormer Team China figure skater Tong Jian guides students to grasp skating skills on Sunday. [Photo provided to China Daily]<p> A figure skating public welfare class, held at the National Speed Skating Oval on Sunday to commemorate Olympic Day, became a platform for inspiration and skill-building for young enthusiasts.</p><p> Former Team China figure skater Tong Jian, a two-time world champion in figure skating pairs alongside his partner Pang Qing, and Russian international coach Andrei Lazukin, took the lead in guiding the eager students through ice skating exercises.

This girl was amazing right from the start. She was so swift… and absolutely fearless.” It thus comes as no surprise she began competing at 11 itself, only to then find herself pairing up with Vladislav Lysoy and Aleksandr Epifanov before finding a long-term partner in Harley Windsor. The truth is they’d met in December 2015 for a tryout, but it was evident there was magic between the duo the moment they stepped foot into the rink together thanks to their similar techniques. Hence came Katya’s release by Russia upon the Australian Association’s request, a move down under, expedited citizenship, and countless training sessions to ensure the pair could debut in 2016. Their first Junior Grand Prix (JGP) in the Czech Republic wasn’t really great, yet they returned with a bang for the Estonia event less than a month later, meaning they earned gold medals. Then came the duo’s 2017 Junior World Championship, 2018 Junior Grand Prix Win, and 2018 Winter Olympics participation, just for them to end up ranking 18 before deciding to change coaches. Katya was thus medically ordered to step away from her love of skating for good, as a result of which her partnership with Harley also came to a mutual end and she found herself isolated, per the movie. Alas, it all got too much for the 20-year-old and she jumped from the 6th-floor window of her Moscow home on July 18, 2020 — she died by suicide, leaving behind a mere note reading “Lyublyu” (Rough Translation: I love).</html3><html4> <title>  List of Russian champions in figure skating – Pairs - FamousFix List </title> <h1>  Russian champions in figure skating – Pairs </h1> This list has 28 members .

The couple regained their Olympic eligibility for the 1993-1994 season and won a second Olympic title, that time competing for Russia.“It was the quality they brought,” Hamilton added. “They were Olympic champions, and Katia was sort of theNadia [Comăneci]of the 1988 Games. She was so young (16) and beautiful, or adorable rather than beautiful. She captivated a lot of people. It was really fascinating [because] at that time the Soviet Union was a mystery to a lot of people.”“Sergei had the look, the line, the quality, and he had great feet in lifts,” Hamilton said. “He was a very strong and big man (about 6 feet, 175 pounds), but he skated with this effortless power. It didn’t seem like it was making any noise over the ice. With Katia, she was always sort of floating above the ice, and they sort of meshed [with] each other. There was no heaviness to their skating, it was beautiful and light.”Elena Bechke, the 1992 Olympic silver medalist withDenis Petrov, grew up in the Soviet Union and competed against Gordeeva and Grinkov while skating with an earlier partner. She and Petrov performed with Stars on Ice for many years, and were present in Lake Placid when Grinkov died.“They were very light, like (three-time world champion)Patrick Chan,” she said. “That is the difference. (Chan) skates like a feather, flowing on the ice. It’s the same talent Katia and Sergei had. They had natural rhythm; that’s why their pair elements were perfect. They had natural harmony… I saw this, and I emphasized this in the choreography I did for them: the lightness, the connection, how they looked at each other, the bodylines.”“Celebration of a Life” marked Gordeeva’s debut as a singles skater, in programs choreographed by Zoueva to Tchaikovsky’s “Serenade for Strings” and Mahler’s “Adagietto.” Just 24 when Grinkov died, the skater wrote a bestseller (with E.M. Swift) in 1996 about her life with her first husband, “My Sergei,” and enjoyed a decades-long performing career. But in 1995 her professional future, and earning power, was uncertain.“All of Katia and Sergei was a love story,” Zoueva said. “They started skating (together) when they were around 11 and 14. First, they were very friendly like brother and sister, then they fell in love, then they were married and had a baby. It was always about their love… Sergei was very, very happy. Always laughing, had lots of friends, loved to skate, loved to perform, loved Katia and loved his daughter. There was a lot of love.”“There is a memorial plaque with several pictures of Katia and Sergei that sits on the wall steps from my office, which is a daily reminder of Sergei,” Wylie said. “Whenever I go to the USA rink, which is where Sergei passed away, I go to the blue line to the right of entrance and I think about that moment. And whenever I stand where the Zamboni comes on, I remember when Elena Bechke ran in and said, ‘Oh my gosh, Sergei fell down.’ It was one of those moments where your life just changes.”<html6> <title>  Meet Kamila Valieva, Olympic Champion 2022 in figure skating in team classification (PHOTOS) - Russia Beyond </title> <h1>  Meet Kamila Valieva, Olympic Champion 2022 in figure skating in team classification (PHOTOS) </h1> Lifestyle Feb 08 2022 Victoria Ryabikova After the Russian figure skating team won a gold medal, the awarding ceremony scheduled for February 7 was postponed because of unclear reasons. Soon, Inside The Games and other media quoting anonymous sources reported that the ceremony delay was reportedly caused by a positive doping test of Kamila Valieva. <p>  Russia's Kamila Valiyeva performs a short program in the women's single skating at the 6th stage of the Figure Skating World Cup in Sochi </p> Alexander Vilf/Sputnik <p>  Kamila Valiyeva after performing her free skating program at the Russian Figure Skating Championship in St. Petersburg. December 25, 2021 </p> Alexei Danichev/Sputnik In 2019/2020, her first season together with Tutberidze, Kamila’s program was ‘Girl on a Ball’ (short program), based on the painting of the same name by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. Then, the program was noticed by Picasso’s granddaughter Diana and personally congratulated the figure skater. She also won with the program at the Junior Grand Prix in France (where she became the fourth junior skater in history to score over 200 points) and then the World Junior Championships. That same season, Kamila performed a free routine to the music of rock band Muse, ‘Exogenesis: Symphony Pt.3 (Redemption)’. <p>  Kamila Valiyeva (Russia) at the exhibition performance of the Grand Prix of Figure Skating in Moscow. 22.11.2020 </p> Alexander Wilf/Sputnik The following season, Kamila tried her hand at adult figure skating with the even more difficult ‘Bolero’ program (free skating), but only in Russia.  Because of the pandemic, all junior championships were canceled that year, but the Russian Figure Skating Federation made an exception for Kamila, who was allowed to compete as an adult. Her main achievement of the season was gold at the Russian Cup. In the finals, she fell while attempting a quadruple salchow and also missed a jump, but still took first place. <p>  Kamila Valieva of Russia prepares in the Junior Ladies Free Skating during the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final (Senior &amp; Junior) at Palavela Arena on December 06, 2019 in Turin, Italy </p> Joosep Martinson/ISU/Getty Images With the program ‘In Memoriam’ and with ‘Bolero’, the athlete won gold at the international tournament Skate Canada, won gold at the Russian Championship, becoming the main contender to participate in the Olympic Games in Beijing.

And for good reason – Trusova is the first woman in history to have landed a quadruple Lutz in (ISU JGP 2018) and a quadruple flip (ISU GP Final 2019) in competition. She is also the first woman to land a quadruple toe loop, as well as two quadruple jumps (toe loop and Salchow) in one program in competition (at the ISU World Junior Championships 2018). She has also performed three quadruple jumps (quad Lutz, quad toe, quad toe-triple toe) at the Russian test skates in September 2019 and four quadruple jumps (Lutz, Salchow, two toe loops) at the Japan Open in October 2019. In 2018 and 2019, Alexandra became the world junior champion twice. Born in Ryazan, the skater has two younger brothers and her father is a master in martial arts. From the age of four, Sasha has been interested in skating.  At first, her parents gave her roller skates, but when they noticed their daughter almost skating on the ceiling, they decided to train her in figure skating. For five years, she skated in Ryazan and then went to Moscow to skate under Eteri Tutberidze. <p>  Alexandra Trusova during demonstration performances at the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St. Petersburg </p> Alexander Wilf / Sputnik <p>  Stockholm.

Russian figure skaters are trained to operate like athletic machines before they're old enough to attend kindergarten. </p> <p>  While their methods are questionable, Russia's churned out many memorable figure skating champions. Which ones  were  the most memorable? Here are the most popular to date. </p> <h2>  Sergei Ponomarenko </h2> <p>  Date of birth:  Oct. 6, 1960 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Moscow, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  Olympic Champion, three-time World Champion </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  Sergei Ponomarenko and his skating partner and wife Marina Klimova made waves during the 1980s and '90s as ice dancers. They won four European titles in a row, and they had one of the longest careers at the time, spanning over a decade. Ponomarenko was one of the oldest skating champions, delaying retirement until he was in his early 30s. </p> <p>  Following retirement, he and Klimova were both inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame, and Ponomarenko remains an ISU technical specialist for Russia. Both of them now coach in San Jose, California, and one of their sons, Anthony Ponomarenko, is now a competitive ice dancer. </p> <h2>  Ilia Kulik </h2> <p>  Date of birth:  May 23, 1977 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Moscow, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  First figure skater to win Olympic gold with a quadruple jump </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  Ilia Kulik was 20 when he won a gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. He was only the second man in the sport's history to win gold on his first try. He started skating at 5 and was initially more on the clumsy side. But his coach noted Kulik's refusal to give up and encouraged him to continue lessons. </p> <p>  Kulik went on to win two Russian national championships, followed by a stunning Olympic debut with one of the most challenging programs ever successfully skated at that time. It included a quadruple toe loop and eight triples. Later in life, he became a distinguished choreographer, touring with both \"Champions on Ice\" and \"Stars on Ice.\" </p> <h2>  Adelina Sotnikova </h2> <p>  Date of birth:  July 1, 1996 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Moscow, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  Four-time Russian National Champion </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  Adelina Sotnikova isn't the most famous Russian figure skater, but she had a loyal fanbase throughout the 2010s. She started skating when she was just 4 at a rink near her home in Moscow. Just eight years later, she won gold at the senior-level Russian Nationals. </p> <p>  She was too young to compete on the Junior Grand Prix circuit that season, but she continued working her way up, eventually winning Olympic gold in 2014. She had a string of lingering injuries, eventually retiring due to chronic pain. </p> RELATED: Meet Ilia Malinin, the 'Quad God' of Figure Skating <h2>  Alexei Yagudin </h2> <p>  Date of birth:  March 18, 1980 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Saint Petersburg, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  Only skater to have achieved a Golden Slam </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  One of the most memorable Russian figure skaters of all time, Alexei Yagudin is the only skater to have won a Golden Slam – a victory in every major figure skating championship in the same season. This includes the Olympics, World Championships, European Championships, Grand Prix assignments and Grand Prix final. He was primed for success from the start, landing all his double jumps by age 10 and five triples before the age of 12. </p> <p>  He was awarded the Order of Merit by the Russian Federation in 2003 and joined the figure skating Hall of Fame in 2017. Since then, he's worked as an actor, TV host and sports commentator. </p> <h2>  Irina Slutskaya </h2> <p>  Date of birth:  Feb. 9, 1979 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Moscow, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  Two-time World Champion </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  Irina Slutskaya had a rocky road in figure skating, but her athleticism and innovation set her performances apart from the rest. After initial success in the sport, she hit a plateau in her skating career, failing to qualify for both the European and World championships. Instead of throwing in the towel, she continued training. </p> <p>  It's a good thing she did because she went on to beat Michelle Kwan at the 2000 Grand Prix Final, plus won a silver medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. She actually tied for gold, but Sara Hughes of the U.S. took the gold in a tiebreaker free skate. </p> <p>  Slutskaya was known for her power on the ice, making history as the first woman to land a triple-Lutz-triple-loop combination. She was also known for her signature double Biellmann spin, which she made up herself. </p> <h2>  Alexandra Trusova </h2> <p>  Date of birth:  June 23, 2004 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Ryazan, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  First female to land two quads in a free skate </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  Alexandra Trusova is one of Russia's favorite figure skaters at the moment. She was the Beijing 2022 Olympic silver medalist, and quads are her claim to fame. She's the first female to land the quad Lutz, flip and toe loop jumps in competition and was the first to land two, then three quads in a free skate. </p> <p>  She has three Grand Prix Champion titles under her belt, and she's expected to continue on her quad-packed career path at the next Olympic games. </p> <h2>  Anna Shcherbakova </h2> <p>  Date of birth:  March 28, 2004 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Moscow, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  First woman to land a quad Lutz in competition </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  Anna Scherbakova is still young, and she's one of the most promising Russian figure skaters in competition. She was the second figure skater to perform two quadruple Lutz jumps in one program, following American skater Nathan Chen. She's also the first to land a quad flip in combination with a triple. </p> <p>  She gets her inspiration from retired Japanese figure skater Mao Asada, and she loves caring for her pets in her limited free time, including a dog named Sandy, a street cat named Mafia and a Maine coon cat named Shiny. </p> <p>  RELATED: 32 Best Male Figure Skaters of All Time, Ranked </p> <h2>  Evgeni Plushenko </h2> <p>  Date of birth:  Nov. 3, 1982 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Dzhamku, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  Earned four Olympic medals </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  If you haven't heard the name Plushenko, you're probably not a figure skating fan. Plushenko was one of the biggest names in figure skating in the early 2000s, dominating the competition between 2003 and 2006. He was trying quads before it was popular, but his artistry was what made him so memorable. </p> <p>  Despite several injuries, including a back injury resulting in surgery, he continued competing all the way up until 2014. He was crowned European champion for the seventh time in 2012 and won a fourth Olympic medal at the Sochi winter games in 2014. </p> <h2>  Kamila Valieva </h2> <p>  Date of birth:  April 26, 2006 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Kazan, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  First woman to land a quad at the Olympics </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  Kamila Valieva is one of five Russian figure skaters coached by Eteri Tutberidze at the same rink. That means she trains alongside Alexandra Trusova and Anna Shcherbakova. She started skating when she was only 3 and trains off the ice in ballet. She's best known for her artistry, inspired by her love of painting. Many of her programs are inspired by famous works of art. </p> <p>  In 2022, she became the center of an unfortunate doping scandal. She tested positive for a banned heart medication that's known to help improve cardiovascular endurance. She was denied her gold medal in the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships due to the positive drug test and is currently suspended. </p> <p>  Make no mistake, however. She was only 15 at the time of the scandal, and her exclusion from the sport is tragic. The adults, including her coaches and parents, are the ones to blame, not the teenager. </p> <h2>  Yulia Lipnitskaya </h2> <p>  Date of birth:  June 5, 1998 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Yekaterinburg, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  2014 European champion </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  Ready to be impressed? Yulia Lipnitskaya didn't fall a single time during the 2011-2012 season. Skating through multiple competitions without a single fall is almost unheard of. The Russian skater adores competition, and her intense training was almost entirely self-motivated. </p> <p>  She even competed with a twisted ankle and ended up winning first in the short program and third in the free skate. She was the youngest woman figure skater to win Olympic gold under modern rules, at only 15 years, 249 days, and she was the youngest gold medalist at the European Championships in the ladies' singles category. Sadly, she retired in 2017 due to injuries and a battle with an eating disorder. </p> RELATED: Why Don’t We Ever See Black Figure Skaters? <h2>  Alina Zagitova </h2> \\ <p>  Date of birth:  May 18, 2002 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Izhevsk, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  2018 Olympic Champion, World Champion </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  Alina Zagitova was ranked as the best female skater in the world in the 2018-2019 season, with countless titles and medals under her name. She is the only Russian female figure skater to win gold at the Olympics, World Figure Skating Champtionships, European Championships and Grand Prix Final, and she's the first Muslim athlete to win an Olympic gold, a world title and a Super Slam. </p> <p>  She also broke the world record under the old system once as well as four times under the new system. She got an early start, beginning formal lessons when she was 4 at the rink her father worked at as a hockey coach. She was named female athlete of the year by the Ministry of Sport of Russia in 2018 and was listed as the top athlete in the sports category of Forbes Russia's Top 30 Under 30 list. </p> <h2>  Evgenia Medvedeva </h2> <p>  Date of birth:  Nov. 19, 1999 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Moscow, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  Only one of four women to achieve a Grand Slam </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  Evgenia Medvedeva is the first ladies' singles skater to win Senior Worlds the year after winning Junior Worlds. In 2017, she also became the first female skater to win back-to-back world titles since Michelle Kwan did so in 2000 and 2001. And she's the first skater in all disciplines to complete two Grand Slams in a row. </p> <p>  Not impressed yet? Medvedeva set the world record score 13 times and is the first woman to pass the 80-point short program score, the 160-point free skating score, and both the 230 and 240-point total score. Now, she's studying at Moscow State University. </p> <p>  Fun fact: Medvedeva has lepidopterophobia, the fear of moths and butterflies. She also has two French bulldogs named Jerry and Tofu. </p> <h2>  Sergei Grinkov </h2> <p>  Date of birth:  Feb. 4, 1967 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Moscow, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  Two-time Olympic Champion, four-time World Champion in pair skating </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  Sergei Grinkov was a Russian pairs skater who hit the ice at the age of 5. He began training at the Children and Youth Sports School in Moscow, but he wasn't a strong solo skater. His coach opted to give him a shot in pairs skating, and he teamed up with 11-year-old skater Ekaterina Gordeeva when he was 14. They won the Junior World Championship in 1985, followed by a string of gold medals at the European Championships, World Championships and Olympic Games. </p> <p>  Tragically, Grinkov collapsed during practice in Lake Placid, New York, in 1995, dying of a massive heart attack. He was only 28, with a 4-year-old daughter whom he shared with partner and wife Ekaterina Gordeeva. </p> <h2>  Ekaterina Gordeeva </h2> <p>  Date of birth:  May 28, 1971 </p> <p>  Birthplace:  Moscow, Russia </p> <p>  Biggest achievement:  Two-time Olympic Champion, four-time World Champion in pair skating </p> <p>  Bottom Line:  Sergei Grinkov may not be around anymore, but his partner, Ekaterina Gordeeva, is still going strong. She started skating when she was only 4 and initially had to wear several pairs of socks because the smallest available pair of skates were still too big. When she teamed up with Grinkov, their chemistry was instant. Their coach once tried to get her to team up with a new partner after Grinkov was repeatedly late, but she was adamant that he was the only one for her. Instead of switching partners, they switched coaches. </p> <p>  The pair went on to win almost every competition they entered. Out of 31 competitions, they finished first 24 times and never placed lower than second. After Grinkov passed away, Gordeeva remarried another famous Russian figure skater on this list, Ilia Kulik. She has two daughters, both of whom skate. </p></html14><html15> <title>  The Greatest Russian Female Figure Skaters of All Time, Ranked </title> COLLECTION 22 LISTS Figure Skating Lists about the beautiful, technically grueling sports of figure skating and ice dancing and the talented athletes who compete in them all around the world. <ul>  The Best Movies About Figure Skating  The Greatest Male Figure Skaters  The Greatest Ice Dancers Ever  The Top Russian Female Figure Skaters  The Greatest Olympic Figure Skaters  The Top American Figure Skaters  Top Female Skaters Working Today  The Top American Women in History  The Top Russian Male Figure Skaters  The Top Russian Figure Skaters  The Top Skaters Working Today  The Greatest Women of All Time  The Top American Male Figure Skaters  The Top Current Figure Skating Pairs  The Greatest Ice Dancing Pairs Ever  The Best Retired Figure Skaters  The Greatest Men Working Today  Top Ice Dancing Pairs Working Today  The Greatest Figure Skating Pairs Ever  The Top American Ice Dancers  The Greatest Ice Dancers in the World  The Top Russian Ice Dancers </ul> It's easy to underestimate how popular figure skating has been in Russia since the first skating rink opened in St. Petersburg around 1865?

(Show more) Born: February 4, 1967, Moscow (Show more) Died: November 20, 1995, Lake Placid, New York, U.S. (Show more) Yekaterina Gordeeva and Sergey Grinkov (respectively,  born May 28, 1971, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.; born February 4, 1967, Moscow—died November 20, 1995, Lake Placid , New York , U.S.) were a Russian-born figure-skating pair who gained worldwide acclaim with four world championship titles and two Olympic gold medals. Gordeeva and Grinkov were teamed at age 11 and 15, respectively, and initially appeared to many critics as an awkward couple owing to a large disparity in height (Grinkov was about a foot [30 cm] taller than Gordeeva). In 1985 they proved the critics wrong by capturing the junior world championship pairs title. The following year they went on to claim the first of four world championships (1986–87 and 1989–90) and were described as lithesome and creative, mature and strong. Their career peaked when they won their first Olympic gold medal with a unanimous vote at the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, but it took a surprising turn in 1990 when, claiming their competitive drive had diminished, they retired as world champions. During what turned out to be a hiatus , the pair married in April 1991. Thanks to rule changes in amateur skating, they were able to return to Olympic competition in 1994 at Lillehammer , Norway, where they won a second gold medal despite a few minor errors in their routine. Afterward they immigrated to the United States to skate professionally. Their partnership ended abruptly in November 1995 when Grinkov died of a heart attack while practicing a routine. Gordeeva subsequently pursued a singles skating career. She entered professional skating competitions and appeared on television in skating-themed specials. She also toured with Stars on Ice , the professional skating company cofounded by Olympic gold medalist Scott Hamilton . She coauthored (with E.M. Swift) My Sergei: A Love Story (1996).</html20><h2> Biography</h2><p> Alexandra Trusova is a Russian figure skater who is the Beijing 2022 Olympic silver medallist (representing ROC), 2021 World Figure Skating Championships bronze medallist (representing FSR), and 2020 European Championships bronze medallist.</p><p> The 17-year-old is best known for her quadruple-jumping abilities.

      "Tag: p, Text: Bottom Line:  Kamila Valieva is one of five Russian figure skaters coached by Eteri Tutberidze at the same rink. That means she trains alongside Alexandra Trusova and Anna Shcherbakova. She started skating when she was only 3 and trains off the ice in ballet. She's best known for her artistry, inspired by her love of painting. Many of her programs are inspired by famous works of art., Level: 4\n",

Skating through multiple competitions without a single fall is almost unheard of. The Russian skater adores competition, and her intense training was almost entirely self-motivated., Level: 4\n",
      "Tag: p, Text: She even competed with a twisted ankle and ended up winning first in the short program and third in the free skate. She was the youngest woman figure skater to win Olympic gold under modern rules, at only 15 years, 249 days, and she was the youngest gold medalist at the European Championships in the ladies' singles category.

      "Tag: p, Text: Bottom Line:  Sergei Grinkov was a Russian pairs skater who hit the ice at the age of 5. He began training at the Children and Youth Sports School in Moscow, but he wasn't a strong solo skater. His coach opted to give him a shot in pairs skating, and he teamed up with 11-year-old skater Ekaterina Gordeeva when he was 14.

      "Tag: p, Text: Bottom Line:  Sergei Grinkov may not be around anymore, but his partner, Ekaterina Gordeeva, is still going strong. She started skating when she was only 4 and initially had to wear several pairs of socks because the smallest available pair of skates were still too big. When she teamed up with Grinkov, their chemistry was instant. Their coach once tried to get her to team up with a new partner after Grinkov was repeatedly late, but she was adamant that he was the only one for her. Instead of switching partners, they switched coaches., Level: 4\n",

It was thanks to these that she earned a reputation as the most “leaping” female figure skater.</p7><p8>“I trained in the old school. I started skating and winning in major league sports very early. This was 2009-2010, when there had been a decline in Russian ladies’ singles skating and you just needed to know how to jump. If you could jump, you would win. That’s the way it turned out ever since I was young. I jumped and won. It was normal. It was how the system worked,” she <a>recounted</a>.</p8><p9>In 2018-2019, she was arguably the most talked about figure skater in the world, after her bewitching performance in a flight attendant’s costume to the accompaniment of Britney Spears’ Toxic in the Grand Prix Series. Accusations that she had “crossed the line” rained down on Tuktamysheva then, to which she just retorted: “I’m just putting the sexiness back into figure skating.”</p9><p13>She is talked about as the main record-setter in Russian figure skating. Trusova was the first female figure skater in history to perform three quads in a single program. In terms of technique, she has already beaten all the adult champions. Recently, a video of her demonstration program was reposted by Hollywood actress Sharon Stone.</p13><p14>The young skater herself admits that only two things in life leave her exhilarated - skating and her dogs (Tina the chihuahua, Lana the poodle and Jack the husky). She has been managed by Evgeni Plushenko since 2020 - and lives in a cottage attached to his academy, so as not to waste time on travel.</p14></div3><div4><a>\\n                    sport\\n                </a><a>\\n                    figure skating\\n                </a></div4></div1></html1>\\n<div0>\\n<span>\\n<a>Home</a>\\n<a>/ Lifestyle</a>\\n<a>/ People</a>\\n</span>\\n<h1>Figure skating legends inspire youth at Olympic Day event</h1>\\n<span>\\n          By China Daily | \\n          chinadaily.com.cn |\\n          Updated: 2024-06-24 15:22\\n</span>\\n<span>Share</span>\\n<span>Share - WeChat</span>\\n<span>CLOSE</span>\\n<div>\\n<div>\\n<figcaption>\\n   Former Team China figure skater Tong Jian guides students to grasp skating skills on Sunday.\\xa0[Photo provided to China Daily] \\n </figcaption>\\n<p>A figure skating public welfare class, held at the National Speed Skating Oval on Sunday to commemorate Olympic Day, became a platform for inspiration and skill-building for young enthusiasts.</p>\\n<p>Former Team China figure skater Tong Jian, a two-time world champion in figure skating pairs alongside his partner Pang Qing, and Russian international coach Andrei Lazukin, took the lead in guiding the eager students through ice skating exercises.

This girl was amazing right from the start. She was so swift… and absolutely fearless.” It thus comes as no surprise she began competing at 11 itself, only to then find herself pairing up with Vladislav Lysoy and Aleksandr Epifanov before finding a long-term partner in Harley Windsor. The truth is they’d met in December 2015 for a tryout, but it was evident there was magic between the duo the moment they stepped foot into the rink together thanks to their similar techniques.</p2>\\n<p4>Hence came Katya’s release by Russia upon the Australian Association’s request, a move down under, expedited citizenship, and countless training sessions to ensure the pair could debut in 2016. Their first Junior Grand Prix (JGP) in the Czech Republic wasn’t really great, yet they returned with a bang for the Estonia event less than a month later, meaning they earned gold medals. Then came the duo’s 2017 Junior World Championship, 2018 Junior Grand Prix Win, and 2018 Winter Olympics participation, just for them to end up ranking 18 before deciding to change coaches.</p4>\\n<p7>Katya was thus medically ordered to step away from her love of skating for good, as a result of which her partnership with Harley also came to a mutual end and she found herself isolated, per the movie. Alas, it all got too much for the 20-year-old and she jumped from the 6th-floor window of her Moscow home on July 18, 2020 — she died by suicide, leaving behind a mere note reading “Lyublyu” (Rough Translation: I love).</p7>\\n</div>\\n</div0>\\n</html3>\\n<html4>\\n<title>List of Russian champions in figure skating – Pairs - FamousFix List</title>\\n<div>\\n<div>\\n<div>\\n<h1>Russian champions in figure skating – Pairs</h1>\\r\\nThis list has <i>28 members</i>.\\r\\n</div>\\n<div>\\r\\nFLAG\\r\\n</div>\\n<span>\\r\\nLike \\n</span>\\n</div>\\n<ul>\\n<div0>\\n<div>\\n<a>Ekaterina Gordeeva</a>\\n<span>Russian pair skater</span>\\n</div>\\n<span>\\n<span>\\n\\xa0<span>0</span>\\n</span>\\n<span>\\n\\xa0<span>0</span>\\n</span>\\n</span>\\n<div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trank <b>#1</b> ·\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<span>WDW</span>\\n<span>36 </span>\\n<span>3 </span>\\n<span>2 </span>\\n</div>\\n<div>Ekaterina \"Katia\" Alexandrovna Gordeeva (Russian: Екатерина Александровна Гордеева; born 28 May 1971) is a Russian former figure skater.

The couple regained their Olympic eligibility for the 1993-1994 season and won a second Olympic title, that time competing for Russia.</p8><p13>“It was the quality they brought,” Hamilton added. “They were Olympic champions, and Katia was sort of the <b>Nadia [Comăneci]</b> of the 1988 Games. She was so young (16) and beautiful, or adorable rather than beautiful. She captivated a lot of people. It was really fascinating [because] at that time the Soviet Union was a mystery to a lot of people.”</p13><p15>“Sergei had the look, the line, the quality, and he had great feet in lifts,” Hamilton said. “He was a very strong and big man (about 6 feet, 175 pounds), but he skated with this effortless power. It didn’t seem like it was making any noise over the ice. With Katia, she was always sort of floating above the ice, and they sort of meshed [with] each other. There was no heaviness to their skating, it was beautiful and light.”</p15><p17><b>Elena Bechke</b>, the 1992 Olympic silver medalist with <b>Denis Petrov</b>, grew up in the Soviet Union and competed against Gordeeva and Grinkov while skating with an earlier partner. She and Petrov performed with Stars on Ice for many years, and were present in Lake Placid when Grinkov died.</p17><p23>“They were very light, like (three-time world champion) <b>Patrick Chan</b>,” she said. “That is the difference. (Chan) skates like a feather, flowing on the ice. It’s the same talent Katia and Sergei had. They had natural rhythm; that’s why their pair elements were perfect. They had natural harmony… I saw this, and I emphasized this in the choreography I did for them: the lightness, the connection, how they looked at each other, the bodylines.”</p23><p27>“Celebration of a Life” marked Gordeeva’s debut as a singles skater, in programs choreographed by Zoueva to Tchaikovsky’s “Serenade for Strings” and Mahler’s “Adagietto.” Just 24 when Grinkov died, the skater wrote a bestseller (with E.M.

But in 1995 her professional future, and earning power, was uncertain.</p27><p31>“All of Katia and Sergei was a love story,” Zoueva said. “They started skating (together) when they were around 11 and 14. First, they were very friendly like brother and sister, then they fell in love, then they were married and had a baby. It was always about their love… Sergei was very, very happy. Always laughing, had lots of friends, loved to skate, loved to perform, loved Katia and loved his daughter. There was a lot of love.”</p31><p33>“There is a memorial plaque with several pictures of Katia and Sergei that sits on the wall steps from my office, which is a daily reminder of Sergei,” Wylie said. “Whenever I go to the USA rink, which is where Sergei passed away, I go to the blue line to the right of entrance and I think about that moment. And whenever I stand where the Zamboni comes on, I remember when Elena Bechke ran in and said, ‘Oh my gosh, Sergei fell down.’ It was one of those moments where your life just changes.”</p33>\\n</div1>\\n</div0>\\n</div>\\n<html6><title>Meet Kamila Valieva, Olympic Champion 2022 in figure skating in team classification (PHOTOS) - Russia Beyond</title><div1><div0><h1>Meet Kamila Valieva, Olympic Champion 2022 in figure skating in team classification (PHOTOS)</h1><a>\\n            Lifestyle\\n        </a><time>\\n             Feb 08 2022\\n        </time><a>\\n                    Victoria Ryabikova\\n                </a></div0><div3><p0>After the Russian figure skating team won a gold medal, the awarding ceremony scheduled for February 7 was postponed because of unclear reasons.

Russian figure skaters are trained to operate like athletic machines before they\\'re old enough to attend kindergarten.\\xa0</p><p>While their methods are questionable, Russia\\'s churned out many memorable figure skating champions. Which ones <em>were</em> the most memorable? Here are the most popular to date.</p></section0><section1><h2>Sergei Ponomarenko</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> Oct. 6, 1960</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> Olympic Champion, three-time World Champion</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Sergei Ponomarenko and his skating partner and wife Marina Klimova made waves during the 1980s and \\'90s as ice dancers. They won four European titles in a row, and they had one of the longest careers at the time, spanning over a decade. Ponomarenko was one of the oldest skating champions, delaying retirement until he was in his early 30s.</p><p>Following retirement, he and Klimova were both inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame, and Ponomarenko remains an ISU technical specialist for Russia. Both of them now coach in San Jose, California, and one of their sons, Anthony Ponomarenko, is now a competitive ice dancer.\\xa0</p></section1><section2><h2>Ilia Kulik</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> May 23, 1977</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> First figure skater to win Olympic gold with a quadruple jump</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Ilia Kulik was 20 when he won a gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. He was only the second man in the sport\\'s history to win gold on his first try. He started skating at 5 and was initially more on the clumsy side. But his coach noted Kulik\\'s refusal to give up and encouraged him to continue lessons.</p><p>Kulik went on to win two Russian national championships, followed by a stunning Olympic debut with one of the most challenging programs ever successfully skated at that time. It included a quadruple toe loop and eight triples. Later in life, he became a distinguished choreographer, touring with both \"Champions on Ice\" and \"Stars on Ice.\"\\xa0</p></section2><section3><h2>Adelina Sotnikova</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> July 1, 1996</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> Four-time Russian National Champion</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Adelina Sotnikova isn\\'t the most famous Russian figure skater, but she had a loyal fanbase throughout the 2010s. She started skating when she was just 4 at a rink near her home in Moscow. Just eight years later, she won gold at the senior-level Russian Nationals.</p><p>She was too young to compete on the Junior Grand Prix circuit that season, but she continued working her way up, eventually winning Olympic gold in 2014. She had a string of lingering injuries, eventually retiring due to chronic pain.\\xa0</p><strong>RELATED: Meet Ilia Malinin, the \\'Quad God\\' of Figure Skating</strong></section3><section4><h2>Alexei Yagudin</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> March 18, 1980</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Saint Petersburg, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> Only skater to have achieved a Golden Slam</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> One of the most memorable Russian figure skaters of all time, Alexei Yagudin is the only skater to have won a Golden Slam – a victory in every major figure skating championship in the same season. This includes the Olympics, World Championships, European Championships, Grand Prix assignments and Grand Prix final. He was primed for success from the start, landing all his double jumps by age 10 and five triples before the age of 12.\\xa0</p><p>He was awarded the Order of Merit by the Russian Federation in 2003 and joined the figure skating Hall of Fame in 2017. Since then, he\\'s worked as an actor, TV host and sports commentator.</p></section4><section5><h2>Irina Slutskaya</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> Feb. 9, 1979</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> Two-time World Champion</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Irina Slutskaya had a rocky road in figure skating, but her athleticism and innovation set her performances apart from the rest. After initial success in the sport, she hit a plateau in her skating career, failing to qualify for both the European and World championships. Instead of throwing in the towel, she continued training.\\xa0</p><p>It\\'s a good thing she did because she went on to beat Michelle Kwan at the 2000 Grand Prix Final, plus won a silver medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. She actually tied for gold, but Sara Hughes of the U.S. took the gold in a tiebreaker free skate.</p><p>Slutskaya was known for her power on the ice, making history as the first woman to land a triple-Lutz-triple-loop combination. She was also known for her signature double Biellmann spin, which she made up herself.\\xa0</p></section5><section6><h2>Alexandra Trusova</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> June 23, 2004</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Ryazan, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> First female to land two quads in a free skate</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Alexandra Trusova is one of Russia\\'s favorite figure skaters at the moment. She was the Beijing 2022 Olympic silver medalist, and quads are her claim to fame. She\\'s the first female to land the quad Lutz, flip and toe loop jumps in competition and was the first to land two, then three quads in a free skate.\\xa0</p><p>She has three Grand Prix Champion titles under her belt, and she\\'s expected to continue on her quad-packed career path at the next Olympic games.</p></section6><section8><h2>Anna Shcherbakova</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> March 28, 2004</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> First woman to land a quad Lutz in competition</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Anna Scherbakova is still young, and she\\'s one of the most promising Russian figure skaters in competition. She was the second figure skater to perform two quadruple Lutz jumps in one program, following American skater Nathan Chen. She\\'s also the first to land a quad flip in combination with a triple.\\xa0</p><p>She gets her inspiration from retired Japanese figure skater Mao Asada, and she loves caring for her pets in her limited free time, including a dog named Sandy, a street cat named Mafia and a Maine coon cat named Shiny.</p><p><strong>RELATED: 32 Best Male Figure Skaters of All Time, Ranked</strong>\\xa0</p></section8><section9><h2>Evgeni Plushenko</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> Nov. 3, 1982</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Dzhamku, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> Earned four Olympic medals</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> If you haven\\'t heard the name Plushenko, you\\'re probably not a figure skating fan. Plushenko was one of the biggest names in figure skating in the early 2000s, dominating the competition between 2003 and 2006. He was trying quads before it was popular, but his artistry was what made him so memorable.\\xa0</p><p>Despite several injuries, including a back injury resulting in surgery, he continued competing all the way up until 2014. He was crowned European champion for the seventh time in 2012 and won a fourth Olympic medal at the Sochi winter games in 2014.</p></section9><section10><h2>Kamila Valieva</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> April 26, 2006</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Kazan, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> First woman to land a quad at the Olympics\\xa0</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Kamila Valieva is one of five Russian figure skaters coached by Eteri Tutberidze at the same rink. That means she trains alongside Alexandra Trusova and Anna Shcherbakova. She started skating when she was only 3 and trains off the ice in ballet. She\\'s best known for her artistry, inspired by her love of painting. Many of her programs are inspired by famous works of art.\\xa0</p><p>In 2022, she became the center of an unfortunate doping scandal. She tested positive for a banned heart medication that\\'s known to help improve cardiovascular endurance. She was denied her gold medal in the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships due to the positive drug test and is currently suspended.</p><p>Make no mistake, however. She was only 15 at the time of the scandal, and her exclusion from the sport is tragic. The adults, including her coaches and parents, are the ones to blame, not the teenager.\\xa0</p></section10><section11><h2>Yulia Lipnitskaya</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> June 5, 1998</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Yekaterinburg, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> 2014 European champion</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Ready to be impressed? Yulia Lipnitskaya didn\\'t fall a single time during the 2011-2012 season. Skating through multiple competitions without a single fall is almost unheard of. The Russian skater adores competition, and her intense training was almost entirely self-motivated.</p><p>She even competed with a twisted ankle and ended up winning first in the short program and third in the free skate. She was the youngest woman figure skater to win Olympic gold under modern rules, at only 15 years, 249 days, and she was the youngest gold medalist at the European Championships in the ladies\\' singles category. Sadly, she retired in 2017 due to injuries and a battle with an eating disorder.</p><strong>RELATED: Why Don’t We Ever See Black Figure Skaters?</strong></section11><section12><h2>Alina Zagitova</h2><figcaption>\\\\</figcaption><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> May 18, 2002</p><p><strong>Birthplace:\\xa0</strong>Izhevsk, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:\\xa0</strong>2018 Olympic Champion, World Champion</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Alina Zagitova was ranked as the best female skater in the world in the 2018-2019 season, with countless titles and medals under her name. She is the only Russian female figure skater to win gold at the Olympics, World Figure Skating Champtionships, European Championships and Grand Prix Final, and she\\'s the first Muslim athlete to win an Olympic gold, a world title and a Super Slam.\\xa0</p><p>She also broke the world record under the old system once as well as four times under the new system. She got an early start, beginning formal lessons when she was 4 at the rink her father worked at as a hockey coach. She was named female athlete of the year by the Ministry of Sport of Russia in 2018 and was listed as the top athlete in the sports category of Forbes Russia\\'s Top 30 Under 30 list.\\xa0</p></section12><section13><h2>Evgenia Medvedeva</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> Nov. 19, 1999</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> Only one of four women to achieve a Grand Slam</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Evgenia Medvedeva is the first ladies\\' singles skater to win Senior Worlds the year after winning Junior Worlds. In 2017, she also became the first female skater to win back-to-back world titles since Michelle Kwan did so in 2000 and 2001. And she\\'s the first skater in all disciplines to complete two Grand Slams in a row.\\xa0</p><p>Not impressed yet? Medvedeva set the world record score 13 times and is the first woman to pass the 80-point short program score, the 160-point free skating score, and both the 230 and 240-point total score. Now, she\\'s studying at Moscow State University.\\xa0</p><p>Fun fact: Medvedeva has lepidopterophobia, the fear of moths and butterflies. She also has two French bulldogs named Jerry and Tofu.</p></section13><section14><h2>Sergei Grinkov</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> Feb. 4, 1967</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> Two-time Olympic Champion, four-time World Champion in pair skating</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Sergei Grinkov was a Russian pairs skater who hit the ice at the age of 5. He began training at the Children and Youth Sports School in Moscow, but he wasn\\'t a strong solo skater. His coach opted to give him a shot in pairs skating, and he teamed up with 11-year-old skater Ekaterina Gordeeva when he was 14. They won the Junior World Championship in 1985, followed by a string of gold medals at the European Championships, World Championships and Olympic Games.\\xa0</p><p>Tragically, Grinkov collapsed during practice in Lake Placid, New York, in 1995, dying of a massive heart attack. He was only 28, with a 4-year-old daughter whom he shared with partner and wife Ekaterina Gordeeva.\\xa0</p></section14><section15><h2>Ekaterina Gordeeva</h2><p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> May 28, 1971</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p><p><strong>Biggest achievement:</strong> Two-time Olympic Champion, four-time World Champion in pair skating</p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Sergei Grinkov may not be around anymore, but his partner, Ekaterina Gordeeva, is still going strong. She started skating when she was only 4 and initially had to wear several pairs of socks because the smallest available pair of skates were still too big. When she teamed up with Grinkov, their chemistry was instant. Their coach once tried to get her to team up with a new partner after Grinkov was repeatedly late, but she was adamant that he was the only one for her.

In 1985 they proved the critics wrong by capturing the junior world championship pairs title. The following year they went on to claim the first of four world championships (1986–87 and 1989–90) and were described as lithesome and creative, mature and strong. Their career peaked when they won their first Olympic gold medal with a unanimous vote at the <a>1988 Winter Games</a> in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, but it took a surprising turn in 1990 when, claiming their competitive drive had diminished, they retired as world champions.</p1><p2>During what turned out to be a <a>hiatus</a>, the pair married in April 1991. Thanks to rule changes in amateur skating, they were able to return to Olympic competition in <a>1994 at Lillehammer</a>, Norway, where they won a second gold medal despite a few minor errors in their routine. Afterward they immigrated to the <a>United States</a> to skate professionally. Their partnership ended abruptly in November 1995 when Grinkov died of a <a>heart attack</a> while practicing a routine. Gordeeva subsequently pursued a singles skating career. She entered professional skating competitions and appeared on television in skating-themed specials. She also toured with <a>Stars on Ice</a>, the professional skating company cofounded by Olympic gold medalist <a>Scott Hamilton</a>. She coauthored (with E.M.
