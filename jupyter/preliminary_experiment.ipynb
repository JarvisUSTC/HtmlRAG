      "<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n",
      "<p>Here are some frequently asked questions about the portrayal of Charlie Weasley in the Harry Potter movies:</p>\n",
      "<h3>1. Did Charlie Weasley appear in all of the Harry Potter movies?</h3>\n",
      "<p>Charlie Weasley, the second eldest Weasley sibling, did not appear in all of the Harry Potter movies. He made his first appearance in the fourth film, “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” and was portrayed by actor Alex Crockford. However, Charlie’s character did not have a significant role in the movie series, and he only made a few appearances in subsequent films.</p>\n",
      "<p>In the movies, Charlie Weasley is depicted as a dragonologist and works with dragons in Romania. While his character is not as prominent as some of the other Weasley siblings, he still plays a small but important part in the overall storyline of the Harry Potter movies.</p>\n",
      "<h3>2. Who portrayed Charlie Weasley in the later Harry Potter movies?</h3>\n",
      "<p>In the later Harry Potter movies, Charlie Weasley was portrayed by actor Simon Fisher-Becker. Fisher-Becker took over the role of Charlie Weasley starting from the fifth film, “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,” and continued to portray the character in the remaining movies.</p>\n",
      "<p>Simon Fisher-Becker brought a different interpretation to the character of Charlie Weasley, adding his own unique flair to the role. Although Charlie Weasley’s screen time was limited, Fisher-Becker’s portrayal helped to bring the character to life and contribute to the overall magical world of Harry Potter.</p>\n",
      "<h3>3. How did the portrayal of Charlie Weasley differ from the books?</h3>\n",
      "<p>In the Harry Potter books, Charlie Weasley is described as having flaming red hair and a strong build. He is depicted as a skilled Quidditch player and has a close bond with dragons. However, in the movies, Charlie’s character was not given as much depth and development as in the books.</p>\n",
      "<p>While the movies touched on Charlie’s dragon-related work, they did not delve into his Quidditch skills or explore his relationship with dragons in as much detail as the books. The portrayal of Charlie Weasley in the movies focused more on his role as a supportive member of the Weasley family rather than his individual characteristics and interests.</p>\n",
      "<h3>4. Did Charlie Weasley have any significant moments in the Harry Potter movies?</h3>\n",
      "<p>While Charlie Weasley’s character did not have many significant moments in the Harry Potter movies, he did have a few notable appearances. One of his most memorable moments was in “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire” when he accompanied Harry to the Horntail’s enclosure to retrieve the golden egg during the Triwizard Tournament.</p>\n",
      "<p>Charlie also played a small but important role in the Battle of Hogwarts in “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2.” He was shown fighting alongside his family and fellow wizards, demonstrating his bravery and loyalty to the cause.</p>\n",
      "<h3>5. Are there any spin-off works that focus on Charlie Weasley?</h3>\n",
      "<p>As of now, there are no spin-off works specifically focused on Charlie Weasley. The Harry Potter universe has expanded with additional books, plays, and movies, but none of them have centered solely on Charlie’s character.</p>\n",
      "<p>However, fans of Charlie Weasley can still enjoy his appearances in the original Harry Potter movies and explore his character further through the books. Charlie Weasley remains an integral part of the Weasley family and adds depth to the magical world created by J.K. Rowling.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Harry Potter Characters That Weren’t In The Films (Charlie Weasley, Regulus Black, Peeves And Winky)</h3>\n",

Now, you may be wondering, “Wait, wasn’t David Thewlis Professor Lupin?” And you would be correct! Thewlis is a talented actor who not only portrayed the werewolf professor but also took on the role of the Weasley family’s dragon-loving son.</p>\n",

      "<h3>The Big Picture</h3>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>The Weasley family embodies virtues of bravery, loyalty, and honor, standing out among purebloods for their lack of prejudice.</li>\n",
      "<li>Ron Weasley played a pivotal role as Harry Potter's best friend, showcasing tactical brilliance and fierce loyalty throughout the films.</li>\n",
      "<li>The Weasley family is a beacon of love and camaraderie, with each member contributing unique qualities that make them stand out in the Wizarding World.</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "</div></section><p> The Weasleys are one of the most prominent and expansive families in the <a><strong>Harry Potter</strong></a> franchise, thanks in no small part to their genuine virtuous morality and close bonds with The Boy Who Lived himself. In the films, several of the many siblings, and the parents play prominent and helpful roles. The <strong>family has also had a long tradition of being sorted into the Gryffindor House, with each member exemplifying immense qualities of bravery, loyalty, and honor</strong>. Despite being purebloods like the <a>Blacks</a> and Malfoys, the Weasley family is known to have a fond admiration for non-magical people and a lack of prejudice regarding those with different blood statuses. They even all fought as part of the Order of the Phoenix to defend the Wizarding world from Voldemort (<a><strong>Ralph Fiennes</strong></a>) in the Second Wizarding War. </p>\n",
      "<p> Though the family was never the wealthiest among wizards, <strong>their stacked house, <a>dubbed \"The Burrow,\"</a> was overflowing with love and camaraderie</strong>. However, between the seven children, parents, and people who married into the family, there’s a whole directory of Weasley kin to get familiar with. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Ron Weasley</h2>\n",
      "<h3>Played by Rupert Grint</h3>\n",
      "<button><span>Close</span></button>\n",
      "<p> The most prominent, and probably the most important Weasley in the series, is the youngest son, Ron (<a><strong>Rupert Grint</strong></a>). <strong>The youngest Weasley boy became Harry Potter’s (<a>Daniel Radcliffe</a>) first and best friend</strong> through a simple gesture of kindness, as the bespectacled boy was thrust into the world of magic with little warning. Ron was by Harry’s side from day one, playing a pivotal role in every one of his adventures throughout the eight films. From navigating the puzzles of the Sorcerer’s Stone, to founding Dumbeldore’s Army, to playing Keeper on the Quidditch team, and <a>helping hunt Horcruxes across the UK</a>, Ron was integral to Harry’s greatest achievements. </p>\n",
      "<p> The two were such close friends that, in <a><strong><em>Harry Potter and t</em></strong><strong><em>he Goblet of Fire</em></strong></a>, it was Ron who was chosen as Harry’s most personal connection to be a hostage in the second challenge. However, it wasn’t just his friendship with Harry that made him important, as <strong>his tactical mind, intimate understanding of Wizarding traditions, and fierce underdog personality</strong> made him a compelling character all on his own. As Harry was raised by Muggles, Ron helped him navigate many of the eccentricities of wizard life. He was a spark of refreshing humor and a reliable friend and ally over the years. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Arthur and Molly Weasley</h2>\n",
      "<h3>Played by Mark William and Julie Walters</h3>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "<p> The parents of the Weasley household are <a>Arthur (<strong>Mark Williams</strong>) and Molly (<strong>Julie Walters</strong>) Weasley</a>, who set an excellent precedent as role models for their children. Arthur Weasley was a firm believer in magical and Muggle equality, demonstrated by his curious fascination with non-magical technology and culture. One of his most memorable creations was the Flying Ford Anglia, an enchanted flying car that was used multiple times to save Harry Potter’s life. <strong>Arthur notably worked for the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office in the Ministry of Magic</strong> for several years before the onset of the Second Wizarding War. </p>\n",

      "<a>This ‘Harry Potter’ Set Accident Is More Terrifying Than Lord Voldemort Himself</a> </h5>\n",
      "<p>Movie making can be a dangerous business.</p> </div> </div>\n",
      "<p> Molly was the kind, doting, and powerful matriarch of the Weasley family. She and Arthur had a total of seven children together, whom they raised with great affection. <strong>Molly was caring and protective of all her children, fiercely proud of their accomplishments while holding them accountable</strong> for their behavior. She was as quick to give a hug as she was to send a Howler to one of her kids. But even such a large household didn’t deplete her motherly energies, as she swiftly welcomed Harry into their family as well. However, don’t let her doting personality convey a misconception about weakness, as Molly was a formidable witch capable of holding her own, as shown in her defeat of <a>Bellatrix Lestrange (<strong>Helena Bonham Carter</strong>)</a> in the Battle of Hogwarts. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Bill Weasley</h2>\n",
      "<h3>Played by Domhnall Gleeson</h3>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "<p> The eldest child of the Weasley clan was Bill Weasley (<strong>Domhnall Gleeson</strong>), who set a remarkably high standard for all his younger siblings. <a>A Gryffindor, like all the rest</a>, he excelled during his time at Hogwarts and earned recognition as Head Boy. After graduation, he started working for Gringotts Bank as a renowned Curse-Breaker, a dangerous and complicated job reserved for highly talented wizards. Bill returns to England to join <a>the reestablished Order of the Phoenix</a>, but <strong>unfortunately is attacked by the werewolf Fenrir Greyback</strong> (<strong>Dave Legeno</strong>) in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. Undeterred by his injuries, he nonetheless went on to marry Fleur Delacour (<strong>Clémence Poésy</strong>), a former Triwizard Tournament champion and member of the Order of the Phoenix. Their marriage was interrupted by Death Eaters after they had taken over the Ministry of Magic, but he and his new wife escaped and later provided refuge for Harry and his friends. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Charlie Weasley</h2>\n",
      "<h3>Played by Alex Crockford (Uncredited)</h3>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "<p> Charlie (<strong>Alex Crockford</strong>) was the next brother in line, though he essentially only made a cameo in the films. The <strong>only on-screen appearance of Charlie was in the picture of the Weasley family</strong> on their trip to Egypt in <a><strong><em>The Prisoner of Azkaban</em></strong></a>. However, despite the practically nonexistent screen time, his presence is still acknowledged throughout the films. After graduating from Hogwarts, Charlie became a dragon researcher, traveling internationally to places like Romania, to study the magical beasts. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Percy Weasley</h2>\n",
      "<h3>Played by Chris Rankin</h3>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "<p> When Harry is first introduced to the Weasleys and the Wizarding World, it’s Percy Weasley (<strong>Chris Rankin</strong>) who is the eldest sibling still attending Hogwarts. A rule-stickler who could be the foil to his younger siblings’ antics, <strong>Percy was a prefect and later Head Boy during his time at school</strong>. His responsibilities included teaching first-years how to enter the common room, as well as monitoring their behavior throughout the school year. </p>\n",
      "<p> Despite his academic and professional achievements, Percy was involved in the most inner conflict within the Weasleys. He <strong>became estranged from his family due to his commitment to the Ministry of Magic</strong>, in particular the Minister, who deeply mistrusted Albus Dumbledore and even denied the return of Voldemort. Percy eventually seeks reconciliation with his family, and he <a>returns to Hogwarts</a> to fight alongside them during the final battle and reconnect with his siblings. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Fred and George Weasley</h2>\n",
      "<h3>Played by James and Oliver Phelps</h3>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "<p> The next siblings were a pair of twins: Fred and George (<strong>James and Oliver Phelps</strong>). The two were the trouble-making duo of the family that brought light and levity everywhere they went, but also became somber reminders of the horrors of war. Because they were identical, they often got mistaken for one another or grouped together. However, they were not perfectly the same, as Fred was more outgoing than his slightly more reserved younger twin. The <strong>twins ended up being older brother figures to Harry as well</strong>, as they played the Beater positions on the <a>Gryffindor Quidditch team</a> and even gave him the iconic Marauder’s Map. Though the two brothers weren’t as academically gifted as their older siblings, they nonetheless had incredible magical talent. In their final year, they decided to forego graduating and instead went out in a spectacular flourish as they set magical fireworks throughout the castle <a>in protest against the vile Professor Umbridge</a>. </p>\n",
      "<p> Fred and George became entrepreneurs and<strong>founded the Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, a magical joke shop in Diagon Alley</strong>. The shop was immensely successful, even remaining open as a beacon of hope during the Second Wizarding War. However, the battle against Voldemort saw the Weasley family suffer immense losses, as George lost an ear to a wayward curse and <a>Fred was killed</a> in the Battle of Hogwarts. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Ginny Weasley</h2>\n",
      "<h3>Played by Bonnie Wright</h3>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>Image Via Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "<p> The youngest Weasley was also the only daughter that Molly and Arthur had. Ginny Weasley (<strong>Bonnie Wright</strong>) was first seen as a shy young girl who had a crush on Harry Potter. Her first year at Hogwarts was marred with mystery and manipulation, as Lucius Malfoy (<strong>Jason Isaacs</strong>) smuggled Tom Riddle’s diary into her belongings, leading to her possession and reopening of the Chamber of Secrets. Though the <a>film version of Ginny</a> never received as much spotlight as her book counterpart, she <strong>would eventually grow and demonstrate a fierce independence and abundance of talents</strong>. She became a member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, was selected to join the Slug Club, and even led Dumbledore’s Army alongside Luna (<strong>Evanna Lynch</strong>) and Neville (<strong>Matthew Lewis</strong>) after the founding trio left Hogwarts. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Famous Wizards and Witches Married into the Family</h2>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "<p> The Weasley family were a desirable bunch, as evidenced by the prominent witches and wizards that married into the family. The major names include Harry Potter himself, who married his Hogwarts sweetheart Ginny, and <strong><a>Hermione Granger</a> (Emma Watson), who wed longtime friend Ron</strong>. Fleur Delacour, who married Bill, was not only the charming Triwizard champion for Beauxbatons Academy but was also a member of the Order of the Phoenix. George ended up marrying former Quidditch teammate Angelina Johnson (<strong>Tiana Benjamin</strong>), and the two would name their son after his late brother. </p>\n",
      "<h2>There’s Another Generation of Weasleys at Hogwarts</h2>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "<p> The books expand on the decades following Voldemort’s defeat, showing that there’s a whole slew of new Weasleys attending Hogwarts. The next generation of students included <strong>Rose and Hugo (played by Helena Barlow and Ryan Turner), the children of Ron and Hermione</strong>, as well as James (<strong>Will Dunn</strong>), Albus (<strong>Arthur Bowen</strong>), and Lily (<strong>Daphne de Beistegui</strong>), the children of Harry and Ginny. Bill, Percy, and George also had at least a couple of children each, continuously expanding one of the already largest family trees in the Wizarding World. </p>\n",

      "<p>James and Oliver Phelps are twin brothers from Birmingham who earned the roles of Fred and George Weasley in the Harry Potter movies. The comedic duo provided much of the laughter and light-hearted moments throughout the franchise, and the duo didn't stop working together after the movies ended.</p> <p>From 2001 until 2011, the Phelps twins, now 36, portrayed the roles of the Weasley twins, two of the older brothers, who were all known for their trademark red hair. The characters were known as troublemakers during their time at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and even opened up the iconic Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes on Diagon Alley in London. Today, you can see the magic joke shop set at the Warner Brothers' Studio Tour.</p> <p>The twins had no acting experience before they decided to skip school to attend an open audition for <a>Harry Potter</a> and the Philosopher's Stone, which was clearly successful. Since then, the duo has gone on to work together in a variety of different projects, including a podcast.</p> <p><b>READ MORE: <span><a>Harry Potter's Tom Felton to star alongside Doctor Who sidekick in West End play</a></span></b></p> <p>James and Oliver appeared as brothers in the third series of Kingdom in 2009. Then, in 2012, they both appeared in A Mind's Eye. They were also involved in directing Journey along the Thames for the opening ceremony of London's 2012 Summer Olympics.</p> <p>As well as this, the identical twins have continued to work together for Harry Potter projects outside the film franchise. This includes the Harry Potter Exhibition and Harry Potter Celebration in Orlando, Florida where they discussed The Wizarding World of Harry Potter with fans.</p> <p>More recently, Oliver Phelps appeared in 2021 movie Last Night in Soho (with Anya Taylor Joy) as a cloakroom attendant. James and Oliver also host a podcast called Normal Not Normal, where they interviewed celebrities such as Sasha Banks, Tom Hopper and Mara Wilson. They have also interviewed former, fellow Harry Potter actors such as Katie Leung (Cho Chang), Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) and Alfie Enoch (Dean Thomas).</p> <section> <aside><h5>Read More</h5>\n",

      "<p>James and Oliver Phelps are best known for playing Fred and George Weasley in the <em><a>Harry Potter</a></em> movies. They, like so many other actors in the films, spent more than a decade of their lives with these characters, putting together an amazing collection of eight films. Fred and George Weasley are a nearly inseparable duo in the books and movies, that it becomes intentionally difficult to tell the two of them apart. And it seems the twins were seen as such a unit in the movies that the Phelps brothers were not hired individually to play specific roles, but simply hired together to play Fred and George. And initially it wasn't even decided who would play who.</p>\n",
      "<p>The <a>Phelps brothers</a> have their own podcast, <em>Normal Not Normal</em>, where the twins interview various people including their co-stars in the <em>Harry Potter</em> franchise. In the <a>most recent episode,</a> the two speak with Evanna Lynch, who played Luna Lovegood, and the actress asked them how it was decided who would be play Fred and who would play George. As it turns out, the decision wasn't made until essentially the last minute, as five minutes before the first script read through, the brothers needed to know whose lines they should read. James Phelps explained...</p>\n",
      "<figure><blockquote><p>Just before the first read-through, and we’re talking five minutes before we’re supposed to start, we still had no idea who was Fred and who was George. So we asked Janet Hudson who was the main casting director. 'Who’s Fred and whose George?' And she said ‘You’re kidding. Good one.’</p></blockquote></figure><p>It seems that basically nobody had considered the question of which brother would play which brother. Even the casting director didn't really know the answer. So she then had a brief conversation with the people in charge, the director, the producer, and, of course, <a>J.K. Rowling</a> herself. James continues,</p>\n",
      "<figure><blockquote><p>You saw Janet walk around to the other side and there was J.K. Rowling, David Heyman, and Chris Columbus... They look at each other, have a little discussion. We’re talking 20 second discussion if that. And then, Janet walks back around and says ‘Right, ok, James you’re Fred, Oliver you’re George.’</p></blockquote></figure><p>To this day, the Phelps brothers have no idea exactly what was discussed for that 20 seconds or what the determining factor was in deciding who was Fred and who was George. They both basically assume it was randomly decided. At the same time, as <a>Evanna Lynch points out</a>, Fred and George are not perfectly identical characters, so perhaps there was some discussion of which one would be best suited, in whatever minor way, for which character. It wasn't their age, as <a>Fred was the older twin</a> in his family, but James is the younger one in his.</p>\n",
      "<p>Of course, there's also the question of the fact that while Fred and George go through nearly identical story beats throughout the franchise, their fates are not the same. Only the first four books had been published by the time that <a><em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</em></a> was being made. But one has to wonder <a>if J.K. Rowling had a clear idea</a> of what would happen to the Weasley brothers, as this decision basically determined who would survive the films, and who would not.</p>\n",

Major British actors and actresses, and plenty of new faces, teamed up to create one of the most epic film stories in the history of Hollywood.</p>\n",

      "<h3>Harry Potter – Daniel Radcliffe</h3>\n",
      "<p><strong>About: Daniel Radcliffe (actor)</strong></p>\n",
      "<section><div>Article Continues Below</div></section><p>Though Radcliffe did not need to continue working after playing the one and only Harry Potter, the actor ended up having a very fruitful post-Potter career.</p>\n",
      "<p>Radcliffe had great roles in <em>The Woman in Black</em>, <em>Horns</em>, <em>What If</em>, and <em>Now You See Me 2</em>. Outside of filmmaking the actor has also had a major theater career: He’s starred in <em>Equus</em> (Broadway), <em>How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</em> (Broadway), <em>The Cripple of Inishmann</em> (on both Broadway and the West End), and <em>The Lifespan of Fact</em> (Broadway).</p>\n",
      "<p>In 2020 Daniel Radcliffe had roles in <em>Escape from Pretoria</em>, <em>Miracle Workers</em>, and <em>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs the Reverend</em>. So far it looks like he hasn’t signed on for any projects in 2021, however that’s most likely due to the current pandemic that has greatly affected the entertainment business. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>About: Harry Potter (character)</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Harry Potter is the main character of the entire <em>Harry Potter</em> series, hence the name on all the books. He was the only child of James and Lily Potter, who were members of the original Order of the Phoenix. When Voldemort (an evil wizard) killed his parents, baby Harry Potter was sent to live wit his muggle aunt and uncle who refused to tell him the truth about his family. </p>\n",
      "<p>Years later, Harry Potter started to receive his letters from Hogwarts — and eventually learned the truth once Rubeus Hagrid came to find him. He had to no idea that he was known as the “Boy Who Lived” by the Wizarding world as the only sole survivor to the killing curse. He began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and his connection to Voldemort began to return.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Ron Weasley – Rupert Grint</h3>\n",
      "<p><strong>About: Rupert Grint (actor)</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Of the trio, Rupert Grint has been in the smallest projects after <em>Harry Potter</em>. </p>\n",
      "<p>He’s appeared in several TV series including a pilot called <em>Super Clyde</em>, <em>The ABC Murders</em>, <em>Snatch</em>, and <em>Sick Note</em>. On the film side of his career he co-starred in <em>Postman Pat</em> and <em>CBGB</em>. He hasn’t totally left the world of <em>HP</em> — he’s contributed his voice to a couple of Wizarding World theme park projects at Universal.</p>\n",
      "<p>Most recently he’s been starring on the television series <em>Servant</em>. In his personal life, Rupert Grint has been dating actress Georgia Groome since 2011 – and in 2020 the couple had a daughter together. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>About: Ronald Weasley (character)</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Ronald Weasley, also known as Ron, is a pureblood wizard and the sixth child of Arthur and Molly Weasley. Unlike many other pureblood wizards in the series, his family isn’t well off and they are also friendly with muggles/muggle born wizards. His siblings include Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, and Ginny Weasley.</p>\n",
      "<p>Harry Potter and Ron quickly became friends at Hogwarts where they were both sorted into Gryffindor House. They met Hermione Granger early on, but didn’t officially become friends with her until sometime later in the year after a bit of a rough patch with Ron.</p>\n",
      "<p>However, once the three became friends they were inseparable. Ron’s greatest quality is perhaps his loyalty, much like his Patronus which is a dog.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Hermione Granger – Emma Watson</h3>\n",
      "<p><strong>About: Emma Watson (actress)</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Watson hasn’t starred in as many films as Radcliffe did after <em>Harry Potter</em>, but she’s been involved with several high-profile projects. She starred in the book-to-film adaptation of <em>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</em>, Disney’s live-action re-telling of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, and <em>The Bling Ring</em>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Following starring in the <em>Harry Potter</em> series, the actress also attended Brown University. She took some time off over the years in order to make room for acting projects but eventually did graduate with an English literature degree in May of 2014. </p>\n",
      "<p>In more recent years Emma Watson has devoted a lot of her time to activism and women’s rights work. She became the UN Women Global Goodwill Ambassador for HeForShe. She also began a feminist Goodreads book club titled Our Shared Shelf in 2016 to encourage the spread of feminist ideas. In 2019, she helped to set up Rights of Women, a legal hotline for people who have suffered sexual harassment at work.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>About: Hermione Granger (character)</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Hermione Granger is the only muggle-born witch of her best friends, Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley. Despite both of her parents being muggles, Hermione goes on to become the top of her class. A fact that leads many of her classmates to dislike her, including Harry and Ron at least.</p>\n",
      "<p>Although they are not friends from the start of the book, they do become close friends by the end of the first book. Hermione ends up being a key player in the war against Voldemort, helping Harry and others work against him in the years to come. Even when Ron leaves Harry, Hermione is always there for Harry — a decision that is heartbreaking for the young woman given her romantic interest in Ron.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Draco Malfoy – Tom Felton</h3>\n",
      "<p><strong>About: Tom Felton (actor)</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Despite not being one of the “big three,” Felton has had a great career in the years since the Potter films wrapped. He’s starred in <em>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</em> and the TV series <em>Origin</em>, plus he had a big role on <em>The Flash</em> season 3 as Julian Albert. He’s also kept up a busy fan convention schedule and has participated in numerous events surrounding the <em>Harry Potter</em> franchise, including several Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park attraction openings.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>About: Draco Malfoy (character)</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Aside from Voldemort, Draco Malfoy might be the top nemesis to Harry Potter in the series. Early on, he tries to make friends with Harry — but when Harry snubs that invitation they become enemies. It doesn’t help that they were also sorted to rival houses — Gryffindor for Harry and Slytherin for Draco.</p>\n",
      "<p>Through the years the rivalry continues and only seems to get worse. Draco, a pureblood Wizard, chooses to fight beside Voldemort with his family which really makes him an enemy for Harry. Though Harry still showed sympathy for his situation by the end of the war they never really moved past all the events that happened between them.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Neville Longbottom – Matthew Lewis</h3>\n",
      "<p><strong>About: Matthew Lewis (actor)</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Known as That Actor Who Had The Best Glow Up, Lewis has also had a great career after his time as Neville Longbottom came to a close. He co-starred in the TV series <em>Ripper Street</em>, <em>Girlfriends</em>, and <em>Happy Valley</em>. He also appeared in the popular film <em>Me Before You</em> alongside <em>Game of Thorones</em> actress Emilia Clarke and <em>The Hunger Games</em> actor Sam Claflin.</p>\n",
      "<p>In 2018 Matthew Lewis married Angela Jones, whom he actually met at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter where she was working as one of the event coordinators.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>About: Neville Longbottom (character)</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Neville Longbottom is introduced as the scaredy-cat wizard that was somehow sorted into Gryffindor like Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Raised by his grandmother, Neville is seen throughout the schoolyears as clumsy, nervous, and self-conscious thanks to constantly being compared to his parents who were also part of the original Order of the Phoenix much like Harry’s parents.</p>\n",
      "<p>In later years, he is shown gaining more confidence as he joins the others in their battle against the rise of Voldemort and becomes an important member of Dumbledore’s Army. Neville also took part in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, the Battle of Hogwarts, and killed Voldemort’s most precious Horcrux — Nagini.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Ginny Weasley – Bonnie Wright</h3>\n",
      "<p>Bonnie Wright’s Ginny Weasley portrayal is definitely a source of debate within the <em>Harry Potter</em> fandom, but she has also kept busy post <em>Potter.</em> She’s starred in a few smaller movies, including a 2018 retelling of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, but she’s also moved behind the camera and has written, directed and produced a few shorts.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Luna Lovegood – Evanna Lynch</h3>\n",
      "<p>Evanna Lynch has always been a symbol of hope for <em>Harry Potter</em> fans, getting hired on for <em>Order of the Phoenix</em> as a massive fan of the series. Besides appearing on MuggleCast several times, she has also starred and appeared in several smaller movies since <em>Deathly Hallows</em> wrapped, including 2015’s <em>Addiction</em>, starring <em>Pretty Little Liars</em> actor Ian Harding. Notably, she also came third in season 27 of <em>Dancing with the Stars</em>. She currently hosts a <a>vegan and sustainability podcast called The ChickPeeps</a>.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Dean Thomas – Alfred Enoch</h3>\n",
      "<p>Dean Thomas was more of a background character in the <em>Harry Potter</em> movies, but Alfred Enoch’s career has blossomed since they wrapped. He has appeared in many TV shows, and has even starred in two, including the extremely popular <em>How to Get Away With Murder</em>, airing on ABC.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Cedric Diggory – Robert Pattinson</h3>\n",
      "<p>If there’s only one actor you’ve kept hearing about post-<em>Harry Potter</em>, it’s probably Robert Pattinson. Cedric Diggory only featured in <em>Goblet of Fire</em>, but he still left a huge mark on the series, even coming up in a big way in <em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em>. On top of starring in the <em>Twilight</em> saga as the iconic Edward Cullen, Pattinson has starred in tons of movies, <a>including <em>The Lighthouse</em></a>. Even more importantly, he’s been <a>cast as the DCEU’s new Batman</a>!</p>\n",
      "<h3>Fred Weasley – James Phelps &amp; George Weasley – Oliver Phelps</h3>\n",
      "<p>These fake red-heads have been keeping active in the Harry Potter community since <em>Deathly Hallows: Part 2</em> was released. They frequently attend openings of various Harry Potter related events, including the grand opening of Universal Orlando’s new ride, Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure. You can also find them doing Q&amp;As and signing autographs at conventions throughout the year, like at Montreal Comiccon 2019 or Silicon Valley Comic Con 2019.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Percy Weasley – Chris Rankin</h3>\n",
      "<p>After playing the pompously-reformed Percy Weasley in the Harry Potter films, Chris Rankin largely put acting aside. Instead he took on work behind the camera, working as a production coordinator for <em>Atlantis</em>, <em>Downton Abbey</em>, and <em>A Discovery of Witches</em>. He did, however, make an appearance as Mycroft in the Hillywood Show’s parody of Sherlock. If you’d like a chance to meet Rankin, you’re in luck! Like his fellow Weasley brothers, Rankin can also be found at many fan conventions throughout the year.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Seamus Finnigan – Devon Murray</h3>\n",
      "<p>This Gryffindor had a penchant for blowing things up in the Potter films, but he’s now put acting on the back burner. You can occasionally find Devon Murray making appearances at fan conventions, but he has mostly traded in films for horses, currently <a>running a stable yard</a> and competing in show jumping.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Cho Chang – Katie Leung</h3>\n",
      "<p>Harry Potter’s first love interest in Harry Potter has continued to pursue acting after <em>Deathly Hallows: Part 2</em>. She had roles in both the <em>Trainspotting</em> sequel and <em>The Foreigner</em> (alongside Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan). She’s also had television roles, like Amazon Prime’s <em>White Dragon</em> and Channel 4’s <em>Chimerica</em>.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Fleur Delacour – Clémence Poésy</h3>\n",
      "<p>Poésy’s first Harry Potter appearance was midway through the franchise, with <em>Goblet of Fire</em>. She wasn’t seen again until <em>Deathly Hallows: Part 1, and Part 2</em>, for her wedding to Bill Weasley and Dobby’s funeral at Shell Cottage. After Potter, Poésy has had consistent work, namely a lead role on <em>The Tunnel</em> for 3 seasons. She’s also set to star in Christopher Nolan’s new film, <em>Tenet</em>, set for release summer 2020.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Vincent Crabbe – Jamie Waylett</h3>\n",
      "<p>Waylett’s only acting roles were in the Harry Potter. He does not, however, get to boast having been in every Potter film, as his time was cut just short and he did not appear in either <em>Deathly Hallows</em> film. In 2009, Waylett was <a>charged</a> with possession of cannabis, and was sentenced to 120 hours of community service. Most recently he was <a>arrested</a> for participation in the 2011 England riots, and was sentenced to two years in prison.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Gregory Goyle –Josh Herdman</h3>\n",
      "<p>Herdman played the other half of Malfoy’s cronies in the Harry Potter series (the half that wasn’t arrested in real life), and is one of the few actors who has been in every film. He’s had a few acting roles since then, including 2018’s <em>Robin Hood</em>. He’s next set to appear in the television adaptation of Anthony Horowitz’s Alex Rider book series. In addition to acting, Herdman also began a career as an MMA fighter in 2016.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Padma Patil – Afshan Azad</h3>\n",
      "<p>Azad joined the Harry Potter cast in <em>Goblet of Fire</em>, just in time for the Yule Ball. She continued to appear in the subsequent Potter films, but has not pursued acting since. Soon after her Potter time, Azad was also going through personal troubles. Her brother was <a>arrested</a> for assaulting her and was sentenced to six months. On a lighter note, Azad got married in 2018, and fellow Potter actors Bonnie Wright and Katie Leung were in <a>attendance</a>. </p>\n",
      "<h3>Parvati Patil – Shefali Chowdhury</h3>\n",
      "<p>Like her in-film sister, Chowdhury first appeared in <em>Goblet of Fire</em>, and returned for <em>Order of the Phoenix</em> and <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>. She did not, however, continue with either <em>Deathly Hallows</em> film. It would appear acting has not been on her radar, as her only roles post-Potter were in three short films: two in 2015 and one in 2019. </p>\n",
      "<h3>Oliver Wood – Sean Biggerstaff</h3>\n",
      "<p>Sean Biggerstaff bookended the Harry Potter franchise with appearances in the first two and final films. He’s had roles in a few short films since Harry Potter ended, as well as a role in <em>Mary Queen of Scots</em>, <em>Whiskey Galore</em>, and <em>Hippie Hippie Shake</em> which was never properly released.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Cormac McLaggen – Freddie Stroma</h3>\n",
      "<p>Freddie Stroma may not have had a large part in the Harry Potter series, but he left an impression. It’s hard to forget his less than subtle romantic advances towards Hermione in <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>, of which Stroma played with the perfect amount of charm and slime. After <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, Stroma earned a role in <em>Pitch Perfect</em>, <em>Game of Thrones</em>, <em>Unreal</em>, and is set to be in <em>Bridgerton</em> alongside Julie Andrews, airing sometime this year. </p>\n",
      "<h3>Lavender Brown – Jessie Cave</h3>\n",
      "<p>Jessie Cave did an unforgettable job as Lavender Brown in <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>, it’s no wonder she’s had so many roles in various films and tv shows since Potter ended. Some of her most notable projects include 2012’s <em>Great Expectations</em> with Ralph Fiennes, <em>Pride</em>, <em>Call the Midwife</em>, <em>Black Mirror</em>, and <em>Father Brown</em>. Her next project is, coincidentally, called <em>The Potters</em>, though not much is known about it as this time. Aside from acting, Cave also published a book of cartoons in 2015, some of which have also been made into greeting cards.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Tom Riddle – Hero Fiennes Tiffin/Christian Coulson/Frank Dillane</h3>\n",
      "<p>Young Voldemort has had a few actors over the years. The youngest iteration of Tom Riddle was played by Hero Fiennes Tiffin in <em>Half-Blood Prince</em> flashbacks. If that name sounds familiar it’s because Hero is actually the nephew of Voldemort actor Ralph Fiennes. Hero Fiennes Tiffin can most recently be seen as the lead in Hulu’s <em>After</em>, based on the best-selling book. He’ll be reprising that role in the 2020 sequel <em>After We Collided</em>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Diary!Tom Riddle in <em>Chamber of Secrets</em> was played by Christian Coulson (pictured above). He made multiple television appearances over the years, including <em>Gossip Girl</em>, <em>The Good Wife</em>, and multi-episode arcs in <em>The Good Wife</em> and <em>Mozart in the Jungle</em>.</p>\n",
      "<p>The Hogwarts-aged version of Tom Riddle in <em>Half-Blood Prince</em> was played by Frank Dillane. Dillane (son of <em>Game of Thrones</em> star Stephen Dillane) went on to star in Ron Howard’s whale blockbuster <em>In the Heart of the Sea</em>, as well as nabbing one of the lead roles in the <em>Walking Dead</em> spinoff show <em>Fear the Walking Dead</em>. Post <em>Fear</em>, Dillane has also had starring roles in three films, including <em>How To Build A Girl</em> alongside fellow Potter actress Emma Thompson.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Colin Creevey – Hugh Mitchell</h3>\n",
      "<p>The Harry Potter obsessed kid-photographer, Colin Creevey, had a memorable role in <em>Chamber of Secrets</em>, but unfortunately didn’t get a cameo during the Battle of Hogwarts (or maybe fortunately, given his fate). Creevey actor Hugh Mitchell has had a low-key acting life since Potter. He appeared as young Silas in <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>, as well as tv appearances in some British favorites including <em>Parade’s End</em>, <em>The White Queen</em>, and <em>Wallander</em>. If you like landscape photography though, <a>Mitchell’s Instagram</a> has plenty of it.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Angelina Johnson – Tiana Benjamin</h3>\n",
      "<p>Angelina Johnson was played by a different actress for the first three films (Danielle Tabor). For <em>Goblet of Fire</em>, Tiana Benjamin was cast, although that was the only Harry Potter film she appeared in. Benjamin’s previous commitment to British soap <em>Eastenders</em> prevented her from continuing the franchise, although she did voice Angelina Johnson for the <em>Order of the Phoenix</em> video game.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Viktor Krum – Stanislav Ianevski</h3>\n",
      "<p>Hermione’s first boyfriend was played by Stanislav Yanevski in <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em>. He filmed scenes with Emma Watson for Bill and Fleur’s wedding in <em>Deathly Hallows: Part 1</em>, but this scene was cut from the film. After Potter, Yanevski has had a quiet career in the film and tv industry, but he is set to attend LeakyCon Orlando this summer.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Other Harry Potter Cast Members</strong></p>\n",

      "<h2>‘Harry Potter’ Cast Members: The Adults</h2>\n",
      "<h3>Albus Dumbledore – Michael Gambon</h3>\n",
      "<p>An actor like Michael Gambon needs no introduction. He joined the Harry Potter film series with <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em> after the untimely death of the original Dumbledore actor Richard Harris.</p>\n",
      "<p>Gambon continues to star in numerous film and TV projects. Of interest to Harry Potter fans, Gambon co-starred in the book-to-TV adaptation of J.K. Rowling’s first post-Potter novel, <em>The Casual Vacancy</em>. Outside of Rowling’s world he’s starred in the TV series <em>Little Women</em> and <em>Fearless</em>, and had roles in <em>Kingsman: The Golden Circle</em> and voiced Uncle Pastuzo in <em>Paddington 2</em>.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Severus Snape – Alan Rickman</h3>\n",
      "<p>Rickman unfortunately passed away in 2016 at the age of 69. The actor had a huge career outside of the Harry Potter film series, starring in well-known films like <em>Die Hard</em>, <em>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</em>, and <em>Love Actually</em>. His final film was a voice role in <em>Alice Through the Looking Glass</em> as Absolem. He also voiced the Blue Caterpillar in Disney’s 2010 iteration of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Professor McGonagoll – Maggie Smith</h3>\n",
      "<p>The actress who played Dumbledore’s right-hand man has slowed down her Hollywood career after Harry Potter. Still, she’s had some big roles: She co-starred in the <em>Downton Abbey</em> TV series as the hilarious Violet Crawley, and will appear in the upcoming movie. She also starred in the two <em>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</em> films as well as 2015’s <em>The Lady in the Van</em>.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Lord Voldemort – Ralph Fiennes</h3>\n",
      "<p>Ralph Fiennes was a very established actor before the <em>Harry Potter</em> films, so naturally, that has continued since the series wrapped. Let’s be honest, it’s not like his nearly unrecognizable appearance as Lord Voldemort was going to increase his cred among the youth. When he’s not starring in Wes Anderson films and <em>Bond</em> movies, he’s kept up his Voldy chops by voicing the character for the Wizarding World rides, including “Escape from Gringotts.”</p>\n",
      "<h3>Lucius Malfoy – Jason Isaacs</h3>\n",
      "<p>Since Lucius Malfoy made his cowardly exit from the <em>Harry Potter</em> series, Jason Isaacs has enjoyed many roles. Some braver than the blonde Death Eater, and some not. Isaacs has appeared in some movies, but he’s largely found his homes on TV. He’s starred in Netflix’s <em>The OA</em> and <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em>, and has lent his iconic voice to <em>Star Wars Rebels</em> and <em>The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</em>.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Remus Lupin – David Thewlis</h3>\n",
      "<p>David Thewlis went from playing Remus Lupin, everyone’s favorite Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, to Sir Patrick, everyone’s least favorite villain in <em>Wonder Woman</em>. In between, he starred in many movies and has since held important roles in <em>Fargo</em> and even Netflix’s <em>Big Mouth</em> (he voices the Shame Wizard). Thewlis will also appear in the upcoming <em>Avatar</em> sequels.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Rubeus Hagrid – Robbie Coltrane</h3>\n",
      "<p>Things have been quieter for Robbie Coltrane since <em>Harry Potter</em> ended, but he has still lent his voice and acting chops to a few projects since. He’s also kept up his role of Hagrid by filming the short that now plays before the new Wizarding World ride, <a>“Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure.”</a></p>\n",
      "<h3>Alastor Moody – Brendan Gleeson</h3>\n",
      "<p>Gleeson has mostly stayed out of the big spotlight since Mad-Eye Moody’s death in <em>Deathly Hallows: Part 1</em>, but he’s been consistently busy, with multiple acting projects a year. Some of those projects include starring alongside one of his sons (and fellow Harry Potter actor), Domhnall Gleeson in Calvary, and more widely released films such as <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, <em>In the Heart of the Sea</em>, and <em>Paddington 2</em>. He’s also set to play Donald Trump in <em>A Higher Loyalty</em>, an adaption of James Comey’s book of the same name.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Mrs Weasley – Julie Walters</h3>\n",
      "<p>Everyone’s favorite Wizarding World mom ended her Harry Potter career on a high note. Molly Weasley survived the final film, and had one of the most iconic lines in the series, “Not my daughter, you bitch!” Unsurprisingly, Walters acting career never faltered post-HP. She continued to star in many UK-centric projects including <em>The Hollow Crown</em>, both <em>Paddington</em> films, <em>Brooklyn</em>, <em>Mary Poppins Returns</em>, as well as both <em>Mamma Mia</em> films.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Mr Weasley – Mark Williams</h3>\n",
      "<p>Mark Williams seems to have largely transitioned from the silver screen to the small screen. Post-Potter he had a couple of appearances on <em>Being Human</em> and <em>Doctor Who</em>, and has been keeping busy with the BBC series <em>Father Brown</em>, which will be on its ninth season early next year.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Nymphadora Tonks – Natalia Tena</h3>\n",
      "<p>Tonks may have been sidelined in the Harry Potter films more than we would have liked, but Natalia Tena did a wonderful job with what she had. Her talents did not go to waste, as she moved on to star in another hugely popular fantasy series, <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Tena also co-starred in <em>Origins</em> alongside a fellow Harry Potter cast member, Tom Felton. Unfortunately, Youtube did not pick up the show for a second season. Most recently she joined yet another massive franchise, having appeared in an episode of <em>The Mandalorian</em> on Disney+.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Kingsley Shacklebolt – George Harris</h3>\n",
      "<p>It’s been a while since you’ve heard this name. Harris’ most famous role was starring as Kingsley in the Harry Potter films, though he also had roles in <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, <em>Black Hawk Down</em>, and the 2011 Royal National Theatre adaptation of <em>Frankenstein</em> alongside Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller. Since Potter, Harris has kept a low profile.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Peter Pettigrew – Timothy Spall</h3>\n",
      "<p>A household name before and after Harry Potter, Timothy Spall has been in countless films and television shows over the course of his career. Since <em>Deathly Hallows: Part 2</em> his most notable roles were in both Alice in Wonderland films alongside numerous other Harry Potter stars, as well as starring in <em>Mr. Turner</em> in which he was nominated for many Best Actor awards.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Narcissa Malfoy – Helen McCrory</h3>\n",
      "<p>Originally cast to play Bellatrix, McCrory had to step down from the role due to pregnancy. Fortunately she had another chance to star in the Potter films, and was later cast as Narcissa Malfoy. McCrory’s continued to hit it big post-Potter, scoring major roles in <em>Penny Dreadful</em> and <em>Peaky Blinders</em>, as well as voicing Stelmaria in <em>His Dark Materials</em></p>\n",
      "<h3>Professor Slughorn – Jim Broadbent</h3>\n",
      "<p>Jim Broadbent was a late edition to the Harry Potter cast, first appearing in <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>, but he certainly made his mark in a short time. The prominent roles continued after Potter, where Broadbent was cast in films such as <em>The Iron Lady</em>, <em>Cloud Atlas</em>, <em>Brooklyn</em>, the Paddington films, and a return as Dad in <em>Bridget Jones’s Baby</em>. He also managed to snag a role on <em>Game of Thrones</em> before the series’ end, as Archmaester Ebrose of the Citadel.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Professor Flitwick – Warwick Davis</h3>\n",
      "<p>Never one to pump the brakes, Warwick Davis is keeping professionally. He’s had roles in multiple Star Wars properties following the release of <em>Deathly Hallows: Part 2</em>. Additionally, Davis still hasn’t completely shed Potter from his life. He’s been known to make appearances at various Harry Potter events, most recently at the opening of Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Professor Trelawney – Emma Thompson</h3>\n",
      "<p>After her final appearance as Trelawney in <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</em>, Emma Thompson has (unsurprisingly) had steady work in the film industry. She’s had plenty of acting roles like two Men in Black films, <em>Beautiful Creatures</em> (another book-to-film adaptation), voice acting roles in <em>Brave</em> and <em>Dolittle</em>, as well as writing credits for <em>Bridget Jones’s Baby</em> and <em>Last Christmas</em>. She also starred in <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> with fellow Harry Potter actress Emma Watson.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Gilderoy Lockhart – Kenneth Branagh</h3>\n",
      "<p>It’s been a long time since Branagh’s first and last Harry Potter appearance in 2002’s <em>Chamber of Secrets</em>. Since then he’s had plenty of acting and directing work in films, as well as starting his own theatre company, the Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company, where he would be actor and manager for five shows between October 2015 – November 2016. His plethora of acting roles include <em>My Week With Marilyn</em>, <em>Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit</em>, and <em>Dunkirk</em>; directing credits consisting of <em>Cinderella</em>, <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>, and 2020’s book-to-film adaptation of <em>Artemis Fowl</em>.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Uncle Vernon – Richard Griffiths</h3>\n",
      "<p>Richard Griffiths perfectly portrayed the narrow-minded, unsympathetic Vernon Dursley, right up until his last appearance in <em>Deathly Hallows: Part 1</em>. Before his passing in 2013, he also appeared in the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film, <em>On Stranger Tides</em>, <em>Hugo</em>, and in <em>The Hollow Crown</em>, the BBC’s adaptation of Shakespeare’s historical tetralogy.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Lily Potter – Geraldine Somerville</h3>\n",
      "<p>Geraldine Somerville had a spattering of appearances throughout each Harry Potter film, and continued after Potter with a variety of roles. She recently appeared in <em>The Gentlemen</em>, Guy Ritchie’s latest film, alongside many Hollywood A-listers. She also had roles in <em>My Week With Marilyn</em> and <em>The Riot Club</em>, as well as in more British-centric projects like 2012’s <em>Titanic</em>, and 2017’s <em>Prime Suspect 1973</em>.</p>\n",
      "<h3>James Potter – Adrian Rawlins</h3>\n",
      "<p>Adrian Rawlins may not have had a lot of screen time, but he does have the honor of being in all but one of the Harry Potter films, <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>. Since then he’s had numerous television roles including <em>The White Princess</em> and <em>Chernobyl</em>. He also had a role in <em>The Woman in Black 2</em>, the sequel to Daniel Radcliffe’s first film, alongside fellow Harry Potter actress Helen McCrory.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Mr Ollivander – John Hurt</h3>\n",
      "<p>John Hurt is British acting royalty who unfortunately passed away in January 2017. He’s had roles in over 200 films and television shows, and has the unique honor of having played the most characters that have died on screen. He bookended the Harry Potter franchise, having appeared in the first and last films. Aside from Potter, his notable roles are truly countless. You name it, he’s been in it.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Argus Filch – David Bradley</h3>\n",
      "<p>David Bradley is another veteran actor who has the honor of having been in all but one Harry Potter film, the first <em>Deathly Hallows</em>. He’s been in many big name projects including <em>The Strain</em>, <em>Doctor Who</em>, <em>Broadchurch</em>, and playing one of the most hated characters in <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Most recently he played Ricky Gervais’ dad in <em>After Life</em> on Netflix, and he’s set to voice Geppetto in Guillermo Del Toro’s <em>Pinocchio</em>.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Cornelius Fudge – Robert Hardy</h3>\n",
      "<p>Another Harry Potter actor who sadly passed away in 2017 is Robert Hardy. His last Potter film was <em>Order of the Phoenix</em>. He also had roles in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> with fellow Harry Potter actors Emma Thompson, Gemma Jones, and Alan Rickman; <em>Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein</em> with other Harry Potter actors Kenneth Branagh, Helena Bonham Carter, and John Cleese; <em>Little Dorrit</em>; and <em>Lassie</em>.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Rufus Scrimgeour – Bill Nighy</h3>\n",
      "<p>No doubt you’ve seen a movie with Bill Nighy in it. It’s a shame he only makes one appearance in the Harry Potter films, in <em>Deathly Hallows: Part 1</em>, but there are plenty of other great roles to see him in. <em>Love Actually</em>, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Underworld are just a few of his prominent film credits. Coming up, Nighy has <em>Minamata</em> with Johnny Depp, and right now you can see him in the latest iteration of Jane Austen’s <em>Emma</em>.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Professor Quirrell – Ian Hart</h3>\n",
      "<p>All the way back in <em>The Sorcerer’s Stone</em>, Ian Hart played the first Potter villain. Since that role in 2001, Hart has been in many recognizable television series including <em>Bates Motel</em>, <em>The Bridge</em>, <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>, <em>My Mad Fat Diary</em>, and <em>The Terror</em>. Most recently he’s been featured in Netflix’s <em>The Last Kingdom</em>, as well as <em>Mary Queen of Scots</em>.</p>\n",

The two did just about everything together. They often finished each other's sentences and spoke in a back and forth way that could confuse others at times. They were trouble makers, often pranking their siblings, particularly <a>Ron</a> and <a>Percy</a>, and even sold pranking charms and spells in the boys bathroom.

      "<div>The avuncular star character actor Richard Griffiths grew up in a council flat in less than prosperous conditions, the son of deaf and volatile parents in a dysfunctional family setting. According to an article in the Telegraph newspaper, his father Thomas was a steelworker 'who fought in pubs for prize money'. Like most children, Richard's \"mother tongue\" was the same as his parents. In his case, that was sign language. Like many kids in the 50s, his world did not include television. He had to explain sounds to his parents, for example music. Griffiths made a career out of language. For instance, he developed a talent for dialects which later allowed him to shine in a number of ethnic portrayals. He attended the Manchester Polytechnic School Of Drama and then began his career in radio drama and repertory theatre. He subsequently became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company where he often excelled playing Shakespeare's comic characters.In a 2007 interview, Griffiths said \"I like playing Vernon Dursley in Harry Potter because that gives me a license to be horrible to kids. I hate the odious business of sucking up to the public.\" In fact, unlike those jovial characters he so often portrayed on screen, Griffiths did not tolerate fools gladly. On occasion, he would get stroppy with members of an audience, especially those failing to switch off their mobile phones during a performance (who could blame him?). He was also highly thought of as a raconteur and wit.The ever-versatile, often bespectacled and bearded Griffiths did his best work for the small screen, excelling as the inquisitive and resourceful civil servant Henry Jay in <a>Bird of Prey (1982)</a> and as the lovable 'cooking policeman' Henry Crabbe in <a>Pie in the Sky (1994)</a>, a role specially created for him. As comic relief he made many a hilarious guest appearance, in, among other popular series, <a>The Vicar of Dibley (1994)</a> (as the Bishop of Mulberry) and as Dr. Bayham Badger in the superb BBC adaption of <a>Bleak House (2005)</a>. He could also play evil and sinister, none more so than Swelter in <a>Gormenghast (2000)</a>, a character Griffiths described being at once \"laughably comic\" and \"a monster like Idi Amin\". He was also much sought-after by Hollywood producers, appearing in a dual role in <a>The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear (1991)</a>, as the ill-fated Magistrate Philipse in <a>Tim Burton</a> 's <a>Sleepy Hollow (1999)</a> and as King George in <a>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011)</a>.The much-acclaimed actor won a Tony Award, a Laurence Olivier Award, the Drama Desk Award and the Outer Critics Circle Award.Griffiths was uncommonly skinny as a child and this required radiation treatment on his pituitary gland from the age of eight. It caused his metabolism to slow to such an extent that he eventually became obese, a condition which in all likelihood contributed to his death from complications during heart surgery on 28 March 2013 at the age of 65.</div>\n",

      "<div>Widely regarded as one of the greatest stage and screen actors both in his native Great Britain and internationally, Toby Edward Heslewood Jones was born on September 7, 1966 in Hammersmith, London. His parents, <a>Freddie Jones</a> and <a>Jennie Heslewood</a>, are actors as well. Toby has two brothers: Rupert, a director, and Casper, a fellow actor. He studied Drama at the University of Manchester from 1986 to 1989, and at L'École Internationale de Théâtre in Paris under <a>Jacques Lecoq</a> in Paris from 1989 to 1991. Naturally, his career began on the stage (and continues there), but film and television roles came soon after his studies.Toby made his film debut with a small role in <a>Sally Potter</a>'s experimental take on <a>Virginia Woolf</a>'s novel, <a>Orlando (1992)</a>, starring <a>Tilda Swinton</a>. Other small film roles included the doorkeeper in <a>Les Misérables (1998)</a> and a memorable turn as the Royal Page in <a>Ever After (1998)</a> with <a>Drew Barrymore</a>.Roles in the acclaimed <a>Victoria &amp; Albert (2001)</a> and the <a>Helen Mirren</a>-starring <a>Elizabeth I (2005)</a> were balanced with film work, from his voice role as Dobby the House Elf in <a>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)</a> to supporting appearances in <a>Ladies in Lavender (2004)</a> (co-starring his father, Freddie), <a>Finding Neverland (2004)</a> and <a>Mrs. Henderson Presents (2005)</a>.He continued stage work during this period, appearing on Broadway in The Play What I Wrote in 2003, a year after winning the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance in the London production.<a>Infamous (2006)</a>, directed by <a>Douglas McGrath</a> and released in 2006, was Toby's first starring role. His acclaimed portrayal of <a>Truman Capote</a> remained mostly in the shadow of <a>Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>'s Oscar-winning performance of the author in 2005's <a>Capote (2005)</a>.A steady stream of film roles followed with appearances in <a>Amazing Grace (2006)</a>, <a>The Painted Veil (2006)</a>, <a>Nightwatching (2007)</a>, <a>The Mist (2007)</a>, and <a>St. Trinian's (2007)</a>. Toby then appeared in three successive films that could have been commercial breakthroughs: kid-lit flop <a>City of Ember (2008)</a>, the Oscar-nominated <a>Frost/Nixon (2008)</a>, and <a>Oliver Stone</a>'s <a>W. (2008)</a>.He reprised the voice-role of Dobby in <a>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 (2010)</a>, appeared in the St. Trinian's sequel, as well as the Charles Darwin biopic <a>Creation (2009)</a> and <a>Dustin Lance Black</a>'s post-<a>Milk (2008)</a> directorial outing, <a>Virginia (2010)</a>.

      "<p>Set all the way back in 1926, <a>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a> was the first Harry Potter spin-off prequel to hit theaters. Considering it takes place around 70 years before Harry starts school at Hogwarts, it is the first film you'll want to watch if you're going by chronological order. The first Fantastic Beasts film focuses on Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) as he navigates his way through New York and the magical underpinnings of the United States.</p>\n",

      "<p>Just a few months after the end of the first prequel, <a>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</a> takes us back to England and features even more tie-ins to the original Harry Potter Movies. We get a look at a young Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) and even get introduced to a youthful Minderva McGonagall (Fiona Glascott). The film itself largely focuses on the villain revealed in the first movie, Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp).</p>\n",

      "<p><a>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a> is the third film in the original series and coincides with Harry's third year of classes at Hogwarts -- taking place in 1993. This is the first film where we start to truly see the darker side of the wizarding world as we get introduced to the likes of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall). We also get an introduction to werewolves from the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), and of course the creepy soul-sucking Dementors of Azkaban.</p>\n",

As Harry enters his sixth year at Hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizardry, he is starting to truly grow up after being faced with even more death. In this film we get our first true look into the motives of Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) and Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). We also get to see Voldemort and the Deatheaters fully on the loose as Dumbledore reveals more secrets about the prophecy Harry is a part of. Although this film starts to get pretty dark, it's also where we see more of Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) and expand her relationship with Harry.</p>\n",

      "<p><time>March 29, 2013 / 8:38 AM EDT</time>/ CBS News</p>\n",
      "</div></header>\n",
      "<section><p>It's been at least 18 months since actors James and Oliver Phelps laid eyes on the costumes they wore in the final \"Harry Potter\" film.</p>\n",
      "<p>But that changed this week when the British identical twin brothers, who played the Weasley twins on the hit film series, stopped by <a>Harry Potter: The Exhibition at Discovery Times Square</a>. They took a trip down memory lane as they spotted the many wands and other props now on display in New York. </p>\n",
      "<p>\"What's cool is when we made the movie we got to see all these first-hand -- and when it's on screen, it's only for a matter of seconds,\" Oliver told CBSNews.com. \"So now fans can actually check out the amount of detail that goes into all the props. You can spend quite a lot of time here.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm being biased, but my favorite thing would be our costumes from the final movie,\" added James, who first appeared as Fred Weasley in 2001's \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\" \"You can see the attention to detail that goes into it. And obviously all the wands. Every character's wand was individual and unique to that character. We were never allowed to take them home because they're in the exhibition. So, it's kind of nice to check in on it.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>When the eighth and final film, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,\" hit U.S. theaters on July 15, 2011, it was met with great success, becoming the fourth-highest grossing movie of all time.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Because it went out on such a high, it was easier to accept it was coming to an end because it went out bigger than it had even been before,\" said James.</p>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption><a><span>\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2\" premiere</span><span>41 photos</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>\"The best memory I have is the <span><a>final premiere in London</a></span>...You could just see the joy on people's faces -- what it mean to them. That it was a chapter in their lives -- not just the people involved in making it,\" Oliver said. \"It was one of those things that I think I'll remember for the rest of my life -- walking down the red carpet with thousands of people on either side of you.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I think we were all ready [to say goodbye] because it had been such a great success and it became a normality to us,\" said Oliver, who played George Weasley during the series. \"The studio was getting a bit worn down after every film. They were going to have to regenerate the whole studio. So you kind of knew it was coming to a close anyway. I think when we were doing our last day of shooting, the bulldozers were actually waiting outside. We needed to finish on a Friday because on the Monday, the bulldozers are moving in. So it was almost like, 'OK, this is finished.'\"</p>\n",
      "<p>After all, the twins had been part of the franchise since the very beginning, auditioning when they were just 14 years old.</p>\n",
      "<p>James remembers picking up the \"Harry Potter\" books for the first time during a vacation with a family friend -- and becoming hooked instantly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Within four days, I think I read all three,\" he said. \"So when we heard they were auditioning for the films, it wasn't hard task to think, 'We'll go to that. We'll try out for that.'\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"The most memorable thing would be the first day on the set of the first movie,\" added James, who just made his stage debut in London in \"The Boy Who Was Woody Allen.\" \"It was the first time we really met Daniel [Radcliffe] and Emma [Watson] -- all those cast members, who have become life-long friends.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And they are still in touch with many of their fellow cast members.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"The best way to describe it is if you go to college or high school, you make friends that you still talk to all the time,\" said James. \"We play golf with Rupert [Grint] and Tom Felton quite a lot. Actually, we saw Tom get a hole-in-one a few months ago, which I still think was a very lucky shot.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>When asked why \"Harry Potter\" resonated so much with fans, James said, \"I think so many people could relate to it. Not in the magic sense, but the scenarios people put themselves in. I think everyone goes into a new environment where they don't know something and they learn from this like Harry does...Or everyone has a family friend like The Weasleys. Or there's that kid at school who you don't get along with.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And now at 27-years-old, the Phelps brothers are enjoying watching the \"Harry Potter\" phenomenon live on.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I think what's happening now is that it's coming to the second generation of Potter fans. People who grew up watching it and had children are introducing their kids to it,\" said Oliver. \"We certainly have seen at the exhibit this week that there's people who started seeing the films when they were in high school and now they're there with their young kids.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The \"Harry Potter\" exhibition will be at Discovery Times Square through April 7 before moving onto its next yet-be-announced location.</p>\n",

      "<p>You might think you know everything about the Harry Potter series, but as it's been a few years since the last film was released, there's a chance you might have forgotten some niche facts.</p> <p> There are many relatives across the <a>Harry Potter</a> world who portrayed different roles, with some even sharing the same scenes. </p> <p> The character of Harry Potter <a>actually lived in Surrey</a> (well, the fictional town of Little Whinging). As the town is fictional, there are <a>numerous possible locations</a> where it could be based in Surrey. </p> <p><b> READ MORE: <a>Man narrowly escapes death after walking over level crossing</a> </b></p> <p> Some of the scenes were shot in the county, <a>including in Bourne Woods</a>. </p> <p>While some relatives only played small roles or were cast as extras, others played bigger characters who were integral to the plotline.</p> <p>Either way, who would turn down the opportunity to be cast in a Harry Potter film, no matter how big or small the part?</p> <h3>James and Oliver Phelps</h3> <p>It'll be no surprise to anyone that the Weasley brothers are, in fact, related.</p> <p>However, James and Oliver weren't actually ginger (a trademark for the Weasley family). They had to dye their hair for their roles.</p> <h3>Domhnall and Brendan Gleeson</h3> <p>Domhnall and Brendan Gleeson are Irish actors who portrayed completely unrelated characters. The father-son duo still share scenes together in the seventh movie.</p> <p>Domhnall played the role of Bill Weasley while Brendan (Domhnall's father) portrayed Professor Moody. Their one and only interaction in the film franchise is in Deathly Hallows part one, when Bill and Professor Moody take polyjuice potion to transform into Harry.</p> <p>Spoilers: Professor Moody dies and Domhnall's character, Bill, is the one to announce the death to everyone.</p> <h3>Emma and Alex Watson</h3> <p><a>Emma Watson</a> 's brother, Alex, may have only had a small role but you'll easily be able to spot him. </p> <p>He shares a couple of scenes with Harry, Ron and Hermione in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Despite the fact his character is a Hufflepuff, as indicated by the yellow robes, he sits next to the trio in the Great Hall scene.</p> <p>In another scene, he's stood near Emma's character in the Hogwarts courtyard.</p> <h3>Ralph Feinnes and Hero Tiffin</h3> <p>Ralph Feinnes' nephew, Hero Tiffin, portrayed the younger version of Lord Voldemort - or a young Tom Riddle, as the character was known before he adopted the persona.</p> <p>He played the villain in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in a flashback scene where we learn more about the character's dark past.</p> <p>Hero is still acting and has recently starred in 'After'.</p> <h3>Emma and Sophie Thompson</h3> <p>Emma Thompson, who played the role of Professor Tralawney, is also related to another actress, her sister Sophie Thompson.</p> <p>Sophie's character wasn't a huge role but was important to the plot in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part one.</p> <p>Once again using polyjuice potion, Hermione disguised herself as Sophie's character, Mafalda Hopkirk, who worked for the Ministry of Magic. The disguise allowed Hermione to enter the Ministry without being caught.</p> <p>Sophie Thompson is now in Netflix's Feel Good. She was also in Emma, Four Weddings and a Funeral and Persuasion.</p> <section> <aside><h5>Read More</h5>\n",

Like all his siblings, he was home educated in reading, writing and simple mathematics by his mother. The <a>Weasley family</a> was not wealthy at all, compared to other wizarding families.<sup><a>[28]</a></sup> Many other <a>pure-blood</a> families, particularly the <a>Malfoys</a>, disdained them for their \"<i><a>blood traitor</a></i>\" beliefs and lack of wealth.

      "<p>The Weasley siblings, especially Fred and George, were fond of teasing and playing pranks on each other, and Ron was a particular target for Fred and George. They once <a>Transfigured</a> Ron's teddy bear into a giant spider, sparking his arachnophobia. On another occasion, the twins nearly got him to make an Unbreakable Vow, which finally made their father truly furious (and Fred would later state that his left buttock has \"<i>never been the same since</i>\" after the row that ensued). They also once got him to eat an <a>Acid Pop</a> which burnt a hole through his tongue.</p>\n",
      "<p>When Ron was younger, he had a pet rat named Scabbers, whom he had inherited from Percy. This rat was actually <a>Peter Pettigrew</a>, an informant and Voldemort's servant who betrayed Harry's parents. Ron was very fond of Scabbers, but wasn't sad to let him go when he found out the truth about his old rat.<sup><a>[28]</a></sup><sup><a>[30]</a></sup> Ron had a fairly happy childhood, which Harry envied, having been brought up by his spiteful relatives, the <a>Dursley family</a>. To compensate for their impoverishment, Ron's mother indulged him in three delicious meals daily. This became so habitual that missing a meal in later life would irritate Ron.</p>\n",

Ron temporarily abandoned his friends, though he instantly regretted it, and returned to save Harry's life.<sup><a>[10]</a></sup> By and large, Ron was always fiercely loyal to Harry and risked life and limb on countless occasions for him.

Some of the happiest memories of Rowling's teenage years involve zooming off into the darkness in Sean’s car.

The <a>Black family tree</a> establishes Cedrella as a first cousin once removed of both <a>Orion</a> and <a>Walburga Black</a>, Sirius's parents. Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed of their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree because both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown.

      "<figure><figcaption>The Hogwarts world expanded for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Picture: Warner Bros)</figcaption></figure><p>Twenty years ago, <a>Harry Potter</a> and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released and fans were absolutely blown away by the third film in the hit franchise.</p>\n",
      "<p>Much like the book, the film marked a notable change within the Wizarding World, filling a darker and more adult space.</p>\n",
      "<p>Fans lapped it up and it has since become revered as <a>one of the best of the series</a>, coming only in second place to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, which has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Azkaban has a very respectable 90% on the aggregator site, and is praised for its ‘delicate balance between technical wizardry and complex storytelling.’</p>\n",
      "<p>Once again starring <a>Daniel Radcliffe</a>, <a>Emma Watson</a>, and <a>Rupert Grint</a> as our magical adolescent heroes Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, it sees them facing a harsher world while going into their third year at Hogwarts.</p>\n",
      "<p>Unfortunately for Harry, now aged 13, his world is turned upside down once again as he goes on a journey to uncover his mysterious past, and his links to escaped Azkaban prisoner Sirius Black, played by <a>Gary Oldman</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>And of course, the film, directed by Alfonso Cuarón, is known for featuring the incredibly ominous Dementors, the ghost-like prison guards chasing down Black, who cause a real headache for Harry throughout.</p>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>The third film out of the eight-strong franchise included a lot more peril, drama and adult themes as the young characters became teenagers (Picture: Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc)</figcaption></figure><p>It also starred the likes of Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Michael Gambon in his first outing as Professor Dumbledore and Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney, the Divination teacher at Hogwarts.</p>\n",
      "<p>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban will <a>now be shown in select UK cinemas from May 31 to mark the 20th anniversary</a>, for those who wish to relive the intense but brilliant third installment of the saga.</p>\n",
      "<p>Shedding light on how such dark eerieness was cast over the film, Gary Tomkins, the Senior Art Director of all the Harry Potters, told <strong>Metro.co.uk</strong> about clever tricks he used to make it look so much darker than the first two – and it was all about the set design.</p>\n",
      "<p>‘There were lots of really cool new sets and action sequences, the Knight Bus, for example, is a very memorable thing,’ he said. ‘And it just felt like a little bit of more of a grown-up film. That was reflected in the sets and how we built them.’</p>\n",
      "<p>As well as it being a more adult venture, it was how Hogwarts transformed for this film that really helped audiences get stuck into this deeper, edgier world.</p>\n",
      "<p>‘The dark tone of the story and the darker tone of the film was reflected in the Hogwarts Castle miniature that we built,’ he explained.</p>\n",
      "<p>‘We repainted it in a slightly darker tone, just to, you know, make the whole thing slightly more moody.’</p>\n",
      "<p>Tomkins added that for this film – his favourite of the franchise – the layout of Hogwarts had to be changed to include the wooden bridge, the standing stones, Sirius Black’s prison tower, the courtyard and the grand clock.</p>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>Hogwarts Castle was changed throughout the films, being made to look darker and moodier, an effect that really worked with audiences (Picture: Warner Bros)</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>The Shrieking Shack was another new set for the third film (Picture: Warner Bros)</figcaption></figure><p>‘Stuart Craig, our fantastic production designer, would often come up with some slight tweaks to the design that he thought would be better. And you know, that’s, that’s why it developed.</p>\n",
      "<p>‘So there are probably no two films where Hogwarts Castle remains the same, always develops and grows.’</p>\n",
      "<p>He then rebuffed any possible complaints about the continuity of Hogwarts from movie to movie.</p>\n",
      "<p>‘And if anyone questions it, we say, well, this magic, of course, it changes!’</p>\n",
      "<p>Tomkins added that predicting what the Wizarding School might have looked like when they began production would have been impossible as the books weren’t completed at that point.</p>\n",
      "<p>‘Of course, when we started on the first film, the last few books hadn’t even been written. So we couldn’t include all the things, even if we were trying to second guess what might come up in terms of other architectural elements of Hogwarts, there was no way we could actually know what was in store for us, but it was great.</p>\n",
      "<p>‘It kept us busy for 10 years.’</p>\n",
      "<p>The production began on the first film in September 2000, at which point the fourth book, The Goblet of Fire, had just been released in July.</p>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>The Knight Bus was another new addition (Picture: Warner Bros)</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Gary Tomkins was the Senior Art Director on the Harry Potter movies (Warner Bros)</figcaption></figure><p>Tomkins also happily shared his fond memories about the cast members, including the<a>late great Rickman</a>, who lives on in the Harry Potter world as Snape.</p>\n",
      "<p>‘I think I’m pretty sure it was on Azkaban when very often we’d be in a coffee bar at Leavesden,’ he said, referring to the Warner Brothers Studio where primary filming took place.</p>\n",
      "<p>‘Alan Rickman would come in wearing the full sort of Snape costume makeup and almost still in character and order his coffee.’</p>\n",
      "<p>He joked that the actor, who died in 2016, was still rather intimidating in his costume, and cast members would insist he took their space in the queue: ‘We would be all like “OK, You first, you first! I can wait!”’</p>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>Alan Rickman starred as Professor Severus Snape in all eight films in the franchise (Picture: Warner Bros)</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>The film is the third in the franchise and was shot from February 2003 until November 2003 (Picture: Warner Br/Everett/Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure><p>He laughed, adding that there wasn’t a division between cast and crew: ‘Often you work on a film and there’s a great separation between us. And the actors are all squirrelled away in their caravans. But because we were the only film in Leavesden, all the actors knew that anyone they would bump into around the studio were people working on that film.</p>\n",
      "<p>‘So they were quite relaxed. It’s not like they would bump into someone that would, you know, embarrassingly ask them for their autograph or something,’ he said.</p>\n",
      "<p>Tomkins recalled that he would often find Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint borrowing supplies from the art department because, of course, they were still children during filming.</p>\n",
      "<p>‘They had an education department within the studios. So when they were filming, they were educated a certain number of hours per day. Very often for their art homework, they’d come up to the art department we’d lend them paper and pencils and that kind of thing. ‘</p>\n",
      "<p>He added: ‘If we could we could lend Emma Watson some colouring pencils to do her homework then that’s what we did.’</p>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>The late Rickman is fondly remembered by the cast (Provider: Warner Bros)</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Gary Oldman made his first appearance the Prisoner of Azkaban as Sirius Black (Picture: Warner Bros)</figcaption></figure><p>‘To see them grow from pretty young 11 or 12-year-olds, and then all the way up through to proper adults was quite amusing.’</p>\n",
      "<p>Tomkins explained that it was like a ‘big family’ on set, adding: ‘Leavesden studios when we were filming was a kind of bubble within which it was a safe space. Everybody knew everybody else. And going back to that cliche, it was like a big family.’</p>\n",
      "<p>The Art Director revealed that his favourite set from the third film was the Divination classroom, divulging that it was built from the same set pieces used to create the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom.</p>\n",
      "<p>‘One of my favourites is actually one of the new sets that we have, at the Warner Brothers set Leavesden for the Return to Azkaban feature, is the divination classroom. It was just an absolute delight. The amount of beautiful fabrics that Stephanie McMillan our set decorator included on it.</p>\n",
      "<p>‘It was actually a revamp of defence against the dark arts classroom. So it’s something that we often did to save money really is revamped on set into something else and they were both in the attic space of Hogwarts.</p>\n",
      "<figure><figcaption>The Divination Classroom at Leavesden Studios is part of the new feature (Picture: Dan Wong Photography)</figcaption></figure><p>‘So there was lots of new tiered seating put in and as I say, all of the fabrics, luscious silks and velvets that were put in it was such a colourful set, it was really quite atmospheric.’</p>\n",

      "<p><a>The Weasleys have become well known</a> in popular culture thanks to their prominence in <a>the \"Harry Potter\" franchise</a>, but there's a lot that casual movie-goers don't know about this clan of pure-blood, red-headed wizards. In \"Harry Potter\" lore, a book called the Pure-Blood Dictionary was published in 1930, intended as a round-up of all the pure-blood wizarding families left in Britain. The Weasleys were named as one of the so-called <a>Sacred Twenty-Eight</a>, though that's not something you'll ever hear them bragging about. In fact, the Weasleys distanced themselves from the book upon its publication and were quick to question its sources: they insisted that they had been mixing with Muggles for years.</p>\n",
      "<p>From this moment forward, the more fanatical pure-blood families viewed the Weasleys as traitors, something they wore like a badge of honor. \"We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard,\" <a>Arthur Weasley told Lucius Malfoy</a> after he mocked his family for \"associating with Muggles\" in the film version of \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\" In the book, <a>he physically fights Malfoy</a>. As \"Harry Potter\" fans know, Arthur isn't just tolerant of Muggles; he is borderline obsessed with them. His fascination with the non-magic folk meant his kids grew up respecting Muggles, but Arthur wasn't the first Weasley to make a stand against the pure-blood mania taking root in the dark corners of the wizarding world.</p>\n",
      "<p>Get ready to know your Weasleys, because we're breaking down four generations of the family tree.</p>\n",

      "<div>\n",
      "<p><a>William \"Bill\" Weasley</a> is the eldest of Arthur and Molly Weasley's clan. According to <a>The Harry Potter Lexicon</a>, Bill was born on or around November 29, 1970, in the early days of the First Wizarding War. He began his stint at Hogwarts in 1982 and would become a Prefect as well as Head Boy during his time there, though he was never afraid of breaking the rules. We know from the canonical video game \"Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery\" that Bill began searching for the legendary Cursed Vaults soon after arriving at Hogwarts, which turned out to be great practice for his future career: he became a Curse Breaker for Gringotts after graduating.</p>\n",
      "<p>Bill spent some time stationed in Egypt (he took the Weasleys on a tour of the tombs when they came for a holiday) but decided to take a desk job back in Diagon Alley after the Death Eaters attacked the 1994 Quidditch World Cup final. He joined the Order of the Phoenix and was able to help Harry during the Triwizard Tournament, where he met a certain French witch. Bill got closer to Beauxbatons champion <a>Fleur Delacour</a> when she took on a summer job at Gringotts the following year and would propose to the part-Veela (magical beings with golden hair and glowing skin) beauty after just 12 months of dating. They tied the knot on August 1, 1997, though the Ministry of Magic fell the same day and Death Eaters gatecrashed the wedding.</p>\n",

      "<div>\n",
      "<p>Born in 1972, <a>Charles \"Charlie\" Weasley</a> is the second of Arthur and Molly Weasley's kids. A British actor named Alex Crockford appeared very briefly as Charlie in \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" (he's in the family's Egypt photo), but the character was largely absent from the movies. That's because Charlie graduated from Hogwarts the year before Harry Potter arrived. He was a Prefect during his time at school and the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team to boot (Harry succeeded him as the team's seeker), but where he really excelled was in Care of Magical Creatures class.</p>\n",
      "<p>Charlie was obsessed with dragons as a child, to the point that he would try to turn the family pets into dragons using paper wings and homemade masks. In his third year, he snuck into the Forbidden Forest hoping to come across a dragon (big brother Bill went with him, fearing for his safety), though he wouldn't get up close and personal with his favorite magical creatures until after graduation: he landed a job at a dragon sanctuary in Romania, the same one that Hagrid's baby Norwegian Ridgeback ended up going to.</p>\n",
      "<p>He joined the Order of the Phoenix when the Second Wizarding War broke out, but Albus Dumbledore asked him to remain in Romania and be his eyes on the continent. Charlie returned to England to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, though he went back to Romania to continue his work after Voldemort's defeat.</p>\n",

      "<div>\n",
      "<p>Born in 1976, <a>Percy Weasley</a> is Arthur and Molly Weasley's third eldest son. A busybody who often clashed with his siblings, Percy was a Prefect and later Head Boy at Hogwarts, so it was no surprise when he landed a job at the Ministry of Magic upon graduation, following in his father's footsteps — not that he wanted to be like his dear old dad. Arthur Weasley had long been in the <a>Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office</a>, something Percy put down to a lack of ambition. The motivated rookie worked under Minister for Magic Barty Crouch Snr. in the Department of International Magical Co-operation to begin with, and he would later become Junior Assistant to his successor, Cornelius Fudge.</p>\n",
      "<p>Percy fell out with his family big time when the Second Wizarding War began. Fudge refused to believe that Lord Voldemort was back, and Percy backed him, calling his dad an \"idiot\" for siding with Dumbledore. He moved out of The Burrow (the Weasley family's quirky country home) and into a London flat, where he was closer to work. Percy even returned his knitted Christmas jumper after his mother mailed it to him. He would ultimately redeem himself in the Battle of Hogwarts, joining the fight against the Death Eaters.</p>\n",
      "<p>After Voldemort's defeat, Percy continued to work for the Ministry and became Head of the Department of Magical Transportation. He married a woman named Audrey, and they had two daughters, Molly and Lucy Weasley.</p>\n",

      "<a><span>YouTube/Warner Bros.</span></a>\n",
      "<div>\n",
      "<p>The fourth and fifth additions to Arthur and Molly Weasley's pack, twin brothers <a>Fred</a> and <a>George Weasley</a> came into the world on (when else?) April Fool's Day, 1978. Natural born pranksters, the twins loved to torment their siblings. Fred, who was born moments before George, is actually responsible for Ron Weasley's crippling arachnophobia. \"It's not funny,\" <a>Ron once said</a>. \"If you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my – my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick.\" The twins also had the gift of gab, which would come in handy when they left school.</p>\n",
      "<p>While their older brothers all achieved great things at Hogwarts, Fred and George didn't even graduate. They left after becoming fed up with the draconian rule of the Ministry's meddling mouthpiece Dolores Umbridge, causing havoc as they went (a small part of the swamp they left in one of the corridors was cordoned off and preserved by Professor Flitwick, who couldn't help but be impressed by the magic involved). With some financial help from Harry Potter, they opened their own joke shop in Diagon Alley. Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes became a huge success, but tragedy was just around the corner for the twins.</p>\n",
      "<p>In perhaps the <a>most heartbreaking moment of the entire series</a>, Fred was killed during an explosion in the Battle of Hogwarts. He died with \"the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face,\" <a>Rowling wrote</a>.</p>\n",

      "<div>\n",
      "<p><a>George Weasley</a> lost an ear during the Second Wizarding War, but that pain was nothing compared to the loss of his twin brother. The Weasley family was utterly devastated by Fred's death, and so was Harry Potter. He and Ron Weasley wanted to find and kill as many Death Eaters as possible when they learned that Fred was dead, though Hermione Granger reminded them that the ultimate revenge would be to find Voldemort's final Horcruxes and destroy him for good. Anyway, Percy Weasley had that covered — he was fighting alongside Fred when he died, and, after moving his brother's body to the great hall, <a>Percy flew into a rage</a>, running off in pursuit of Death Eater Augustus Rookwood.</p>\n",
      "<p>No other Weasleys were lost during the remainder of the battle. George would later pay tribute to his fallen twin by naming his son after him. He had two kids with none other than <a>Angelina Johnson</a>, his former teammate on the Gryffindor Quidditch team (Fred and George both played as beaters for their house). Angelina actually attended the Yule Ball — the Christmas party thrown in honor of the Triwizard Tournament champions — as Fred's date in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\" She and George would bond over their shared loss, tying the knot and starting a family: son, Fred Weasley II, was followed by a daughter, Roxanne Weasley. George also honored his brother by keeping Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes going.</p>\n",

      "<p>The youngest of Arthur and Molly Weasley's six boys, <a>Ronald \"Ron\" Weasley</a> had \"a lot to live up to\" when he boarded the Hogwarts Express for the first time in 1991. His brothers had set the bar time during their time at school, and their shadows loomed large over young Ron. \"Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first,\" <a>he said</a>. While he often struggled during his first few years (breaking his wand, a hand-me-down from brother Charlie, didn't help his cause), Ron proved himself more than capable when called upon to do his bit in the fight against Voldemort.</p>\n",
      "<p>After the Second Wizarding War, the new Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt made Ron an Auror, the Ministry's top line of magical law enforcement. After a few years, he left to work with George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. He and childhood friend <a>Hermione Granger</a> (who would later become Minister for Magic) married and had two children, <a>Rose Granger-Weasley</a> and Hugo Granger-Weasley, born around two years apart. While little is known about Hugo, we know that Rose turned into a brilliant witch. \"Thank God you inherited your mother's brains,\" <a>Ron told her</a> as she left for Hogwarts for the first time in 2017. She wasn't all Hermione, however: Rose followed in her dad's footsteps when she joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team as a chaser.</p>\n",

      "<p>Born in 1981, <a>Ginerva \"Ginny\" Weasley</a> was the first female Weasley in generations, though she would add another girl to the clan when she had kids herself. Ginny developed a crush on family friend Harry Potter when she was a young girl and in time those feelings would come to be reciprocated. Harry officially became part of the Weasley family when he married Ginny, and the couple had three children: James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter, and Lily Luna Potter, named after Harry's mother and the couple's school friend, Luna Lovegood.</p>\n",
      "<p>The Weasleys were always a Quidditch family, but they saved the best player for last. Ginny was a chaser and later as a seeker for the Gryffindor team, and she would go pro after leaving Hogwarts, playing for the Holyhead Harpies (an all-female team founded in 1203). She hung up her broomstick when she and Harry decided to start a family, but she remained involved with the sport, landing the role of Quidditch reporter at the Daily Prophet.</p>\n",
      "<p>When the Weasleys attended the 2014 <a>Quidditch World Cup final in Argentina</a>, Ginny was on the job. She covered the event live alongside Rita Skeeter, who seemed more interested in the presence of Ginny's \"publicity-hungry\" husband. Skeeter was \"taken unaccountably ill with what some are calling a jinx to the solar plexus,\" said Ginny. By 2020, Ginny was running the Prophet's Quidditch content as the paper's sports editor.</p>\n",

He was the younger brother of <a>Bill</a> and <a>Charlie</a>, the older brother of the late <a>Fred Weasley</a>, <a>George</a>, <a>Ron</a> and <a>Ginny</a>. He attended <a>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a> from <a>1987</a>-<a>1994</a>, and was both a <a>prefect</a> and <a>Head Boy</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>He took the rules very seriously, and did not believe that his brothers Fred and George would get very far in school because of their constant pranking. It was also once stated by his brother Ron that \"<i>Percy wouldn't know a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing <a>Dobby</a>'s tea cosy</i>\". A high achiever, he went to work at the <a>Ministry of Magic</a> after leaving school, working in the <a>Department of International Magical Co-operation</a> under <a>Barty Crouch Snr</a> and later as <a>Junior Assistant to the Minister for Magic</a> himself.</p>\n",
      "<p>However, Percy's rise through the Ministry caused a rift between him and his family following the <a>return</a> of <a>Lord Voldemort</a>. His father thought that his promotion to <a>Minister for Magic</a> <a>Cornelius Fudge</a>'s office was a plot by the Minister to keep tabs on the Weasleys, and through them, <a>Albus Dumbledore</a>. Percy denied this and remained steadfastly loyal to the Ministry's lie that Voldemort was not back.</p>\n",
      "<p>He estranged himself from his family and furthermore condemned them for their support of and affiliation with Albus Dumbledore and the <a>Order of the Phoenix</a>. Even though the Ministry did accept that the Dark Lord had indeed returned following the <a>Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, Percy's shame over his behavior stopped him from reconciling with his family.</p>\n",
      "<p>After the <a>fall of the Ministry</a> to the <a>Death Eaters</a> in <a>1997</a>, Percy finally realized just how corrupt the Ministry was and fully accepted that he had been wrong the whole time and abandoned the Ministry. Percy was tipped off by <a>Aberforth Dumbledore</a> about the <a>Battle of Hogwarts</a> in <a>1998</a> and finally made up with his family. He survived the battle but was grief-stricken over the death of his brother Fred, whom he was fighting alongside and was determined to avenge.</p>\n",
      "<p>Following the downfall of Voldemort, Percy returned to work for the Ministry and became Head of the <a>Department of Magical Transportation</a><sup><a>[7]</a></sup> under the new Minister for Magic, <a>Kingsley Shacklebolt</a>. He married a woman named <a>Audrey</a> and had two daughters, <a>Molly</a>, named after her paternal grandmother, and <a>Lucy</a>.</p>\n",

In the fighting, his maternal uncles, <a>Fabian</a> and <a>Gideon Prewett</a>, both members of the <a>Order of the Phoenix</a>, were murdered fighting <a>Antonin Dolohov</a> and four other <a>Death Eaters</a>.<sup><a>[13]</a></sup> While he was still a child, the wizarding world became peaceful again (for a time) after <a>Lord Voldemort</a>'s first defeat on <a>31 October</a>, <a>1981</a>.</p>\n",

Like all his siblings, he was home educated in reading, writing and mathematics by his mother.</p>\n",
      "<p>The Weasley family was not wealthy at all, compared to other wizarding families. Many other <a>pure-blood</a> families, particularly the Malfoys, disdained them for their \"<i><a>blood traitor</a></i>\" beliefs and lack of wealth. However, this did not bother the Weasleys and they continued to stand by their beliefs. Also Molly and Arthur tried their best to make up for this with their <a>love</a>.<sup><a>[14]</a></sup></p>\n",
      "<p>When Percy was seven his five-year-old brother Fred <a>transformed</a> Ron's teddy bear into a giant <a>spider</a>, which caused Ron's arachnophobia.

On the same day, the <a>Ministry of Magic</a> was overthrown by <a>Death Eaters</a>, and Rufus Scrimgeour was killed and replaced by <a>Pius Thicknesse</a>, a puppet of Voldemort's.</p>\n",
      "<p>Percy finally began to see what was happening around him, but could do nothing since he was being watched closely. He continued to work at the Ministry, presumably under the new Minister.

In the room, he found the majority of his family trying to restrain <a>Ginny</a> from joining the battle. In a tense moment, Percy apologised profusely to them, and his brother <a>Fred</a>, who, along with <a>George</a>, were the most vocal in their anger towards Percy, was the first to forgive him.

      "<p>After Voldemort subjugated Crouch and forced him to write letters to declare sickness, Weasley obeyed the orders via these letters unquestioningly.

      "<p>Crouch also indirectly proved to be a major factor for Percy's huge loyalty to the Ministry and his temporary estrangement from his own family, especially as his twin brothers Fred and George Weasley started teasing him more and his younger brother Ron stopped trusting him after learning of Crouch's son. Additionally, the trouble Percy got into over Crouch's disappearance only made him more ambitious to the point that he accepted the post of Junior Assistant to the Minister for Magic under Fudge without question, and put his Ministry career before his own family when Voldemort returned to full power, just as Crouch had done.</p>\n",
      "<p>It is unknown what Percy thought of Crouch after the man had been found insane in the <a>Forbidden Forest</a> and participated in breaking out his criminal son from Azkaban, and it is unknown how Percy reacted when learning of his death. It is likely, however, that as he eventually grew to realise how wrong he was in choosing his career over his own family, Percy felt both disgust and pity towards his former superior.</p>\n",
      "<p>On one hand, he had come to dearly regret that he had supported the government so thoroughly in his ambition that he didn't realise he was supporting his family being put in danger and would have surely been repulsed that he once supported Crouch upon learning of how he had condemned and neglected his own son, but on the other hand, Crouch's willingness to rescue his son and how he ended up dying due to how too late he was in showing love towards his son might have earned him a degree of pity from Percy.</p>\n",

Ironically, this led to Percy's defection from his family. Percy commented in his <a>letter</a> to his younger brother <a>Ron</a> that the Minister would not be more gracious to him for this defection. He agreed with Fudge on that Harry was violent and disturbed, as that Dumbledore was plotting to overthrow Fudge when the Ministry began publishing articles.</p>\n",
      "<p>Over the final year of Fudge's term as Minister, he used Percy as the court scribe on at least two occasions: <a>Harry's disciplinary hearing</a> and the meeting in the Headmaster's Office following the <a>discovery of Dumbledore's Army</a>. Percy, during both moments, heartily agreed with Fudge's decisions, and even laughed when Fudge made insulting mockeries at Harry and Dumbledore. When Fudge's folly had been exposed and he was forced to resign as Minister in complete disgrace, most likely Percy became bitter and resentful that he had supported Fudge's completely disastrous and wrong campaign against Dumbledore and Harry against his own family.</p>\n",
      "<p>While he remained loyal to the Ministry, it is apparent that he felt no sympathy for Fudge's dismissal and may have even supported it some ways. Regardless, the damage that Fudge had caused to Percy's relationships with his family was done and it took 2 years before Percy was finally able to reconcile with them. Afterwards, Percy helped Kingsley with completely reforming the Ministry, which included purging the corruptions Fudge had left.</p>\n",

      "<p>In the \"Harry Potter\" film franchise, viewers are introduced to a bevy of different characters. Some of the first people to whom we're introduced are the title character's muggle relatives and caretakers, <a>the Dursleys</a>: uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw), and cousin Dudley (Harry Melling). But from there on out, it's mostly witches and wizards, with the occasional werewolf thrown in there for good measure. Notable exceptions are Hermione Granger's (Emma Watson) parents, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry's caretaker, Argus Filch (David Bradley), and Harry's neighbor Arabella Figg (Kathryn Hunter), the latter two of whom are both squibs.</p>\n",
      "<p>Whether witches and wizards of the dark or light persuasion, most every other character is magical in nature. Many of Harry Potter's allies come in the form of current or former professors at Hogwarts, though some — like former auror Alastor Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and his protege, Nymphadora Tonks (Natalia Tena) — worked directly for the Ministry of Magic, including Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams). That brings up another common factor among many of Harry's allies and characters as a whole: many of them are related! There's certainly no shortage of Weasleys in the Wizarding World. From Harry's best friend and future wife, <a>members of the Weasley family</a> play a large role in the overall story. But with so many members of the sprawling family coming and going, casual viewers could be forgiven if they're unable to keep them all straight. This is the \"Harry Potter\" franchise's Weasley family tree, fully explained.</p>\n",

      "<p><a>Ronald Bilius Weasley (Rupert Grint)</a> is the youngest of the six Weasley boys and second youngest child of Arthur and Molly Weasley (Julie Walters). His overall significance to the Wizarding World is obvious: he's Harry Potter's best friend. The two first met at King's Cross Station in \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" when the title character was trying to make his way to Platform 9 &amp; 3/4. Unable to locate it, Harry notices a group of children running full force toward a wall, only to disappear; meet the Weasleys! Noticing young Harry's dismay, matriarch Molly realizes he must be a first year, just like her son Ron. She told Harry that all he needed to do is walk straight at the wall between Platform 9 and Platform 10, advising that it's \"Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.\" With a quick wish of \"Good luck\" from his future wife, Ginny, Harry is off and makes it through without issue — though the same can't be said of his second attempt in <a>\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,\"</a> courtesy of Dobby the House Elf.</p>\n",
      "<p>Harry and Ron shared a compartment on the Hogwarts Express and became fast friends, with the former treating the latter to a candy binge from the snack cart. They had their ups and downs throughout the films and books but Ron remained Harry's loyal friend throughout, often taking up for him when seemingly no one else would.</p>\n",

      "<p>We meet Ginevra <a>\"Ginny\" Weasley (Bonne Wright) when Harry Potter</a> meets the rest of the family in \"Sorcerer's Stone.\" Little did we know that the smiling little sprite who wished him good luck getting to Platform 9 &amp; 3/4 was destined to become Harry's girlfriend and eventual wife. Ginny tags along for much of the adventure in the early movies, though she becomes a much bigger part of the story later on. Ginny is the seventh child and only daughter of Arthur and Molly Weasley, which means she grew up in a house with six older brothers; it's no wonder she has no trouble making herself heard on the Quidditch pitch in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,\" when she and Harry are putting new Gryffindor recruits through the paces.</p>\n",
      "<p>Prior to dating Harry, Ginny attended the Yule Ball with <a>Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis)</a> and had a rocky relationship with boyfriend Dean Thomas (Alfred Enoch). Ginny and Harry go on to have three children, as we see in the epilogue to \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.\" Their eldest son, James Sirius, was named in honor of Harry's late father, James, and his late godfather, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman). Their middle child, son Albus Severus, was named after two of the greatest Hogwarts headmasters in history, Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Their third child and only daughter, Lily Luna, was named after Harry's late mother, Lily, and their friend, Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch).</p>\n",

      "<div>\n",
      "<p>Ron Weasley has two older brothers — a pair of twins, in fact — named <a>Fred and George (James and Oliver Phelps</a>, respectively). Aside from Ron, they're the Weasley children with whom viewers should be most familiar, given their penchant for shenanigans and cracking jokes. A pair of natural pranksters, Fred and George were born on April 1 — yes, that's right, April Fool's Day — which should surprise approximately no one. Nearly inseparable, the twins were as loyal to each other as they were to Harry Potter and Ron, to whom they were two years senior.</p>\n",
      "<p>Fred and George had so many tricks up their sleeves that they decided to drop out of Hogwarts prior to graduating so that they could open a joke shop — cleverly called Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes — in Diagon Alley. Both twins agreed to go undercover, drinking polyjuice potion so as to take on Harry's likeness in \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,\" in order to help him attempt to make it from the Dursleys' home in Little Whinging to the Weasley family home, the Burrow, with the greatest success. For his part, George lost an ear in the ensuing battle. Tragically Fred was killed in the course of the final film, losing his life to a Death Eater during the Battle of Hogwarts. George would go on to marry Angelina Johnson (Tiana Benjamin) — his Gryffindor Quidditch teammate and Fred's date to the Yule Ball — and they named their son in honor of George's late twin brother.</p>\n",

      "<p>Good ol' Percy Weasley (Chris Rankin), such a bore. Obviously the <a>Weasley family</a> gene pool was hoarding the humor for a double shot with Fred and George, so their elder brother was seemingly born with none. The third eldest Weasley child, Percy was two years older than his fun-loving twin brothers, making him four years senior to Ron. He was also a big fan of going by the book; it's probably why he was a Gryffindor Prefect and went on to serve as Head Boy, a fact which viewers heard him shout during \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" when the unruly mob of Gryffindors were searching for the Fat Lady portrait.</p>\n",
      "<p>Percy's stick-in-the-mud nature served him well and, upon graduating, he went to work for the Ministry of Magic, much like his father, Arthur. Unlike his father, whose fascination with the non-magical people of the world led him to the Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, Percy eventually became an assistant to the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. He's not seen as much after he helps round up the students in Dumbledore's Army in \"Order of the Phoenix,\" having drank the Ministry Kool-Aid and staunchly holding to the mistaken belief that Lord Voldemort had not returned; that must have made for awkward family interactions considering the rest of his family was in the Order and were fighting against Voldemort's forces.</p>\n",

      "<p>The two oldest Wesley brothers don't get a lot of screen time in the \"Harry Potter\" films. We don't meet the eldest Weasley child, Bill (Domhnall Gleeson), until the beginning of the penultimate film, \"Deathly Hallows: Part 1.\" When the Order of the Phoenix shows up in Little Whinging to whisk Harry away to the safety of the Weasley Burrow, Bill walks in and introduces himself, then gives a brief explanation for his facial scar; he had a run-in with the werewolf Fenrir Greyback (Dave Legeno), who had actually attacked the Burrow with Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) in \"Half-Blood Prince.\" Viewers should recognize Bill's girlfriend, Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy), from the fourth film, \"Goblet of Fire\"; she was the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic's TriWizard champion, after all. Fortunately, Bill and Fleur make it safely through the Battle of the Seven Potters — with Fleur in the form of Harry Potter after drinking Polyjuice Potion — and they are married in \"Deathly Hallows: Part 1.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Ron's brother Charlie (Alex Crockford) never gets a proper introduction and we know precious little about him. He does appear onscreen in the briefest of moments in a family photo when Ron shows Harry the pictures from the Weasley family vacation to Egypt. That's the only time Charlie makes an appearance on screen. We do, however, know his chosen magical vocation: he studied dragons in Romania. In fact, he helped provide the dragons for the first task of the TwiWizard Tournament in the fourth film.</p>\n",

      "<h2>Father Arthur Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic</h2>\n",

      "<div>\n",
      "<p>Arthur Weasley is a man of simple means. A full-time employee of the Ministry of Magic, working in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, he puts in long hours to support the large family — with seven children in total — he has with wife Molly. What you may not know about Arthur is that he's a distant relative of Harry Potter's godfather, Sirius Black; his mother, after all, was Cedrella Black. Arthur's great uncle on his mother's side, Sirius Black II, was the great-grandfather of Sirius Black III, who befriends James Potter at Howarts, making Arthur and Sirius III second cousins, once removed. This could explain how and-or why Arthur shows such a fatherly disposition to young Harry and plays a similar role in the Chosen One's life.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was Arthur, of course, who warned Harry about Sirius' escape from Azkaban, still believing at the time that Harry's godfather had been the one to betray his parents and that he'd killed Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall). We can forgive Arthur for that, since he was only acting in the boy's best interest. Two years later, when Harry is on trial for using magic outside of school while still underage — despite the fact that Minister Cornelius Fudge had jokingly told Harry that wizards aren't sent to prison for blowing up their aunts in \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" — Arthur is the one who escorts him to Ministry headquarters. Of course, Harry more than repays the favor and the kindness Arthur has shown him over the years when he tells Dumbledore that Arthur has been attacked after seeing it in a vision through his connection to Voldemort.</p>\n",

      "<div>Daniel Jacob Radcliffe was born on July 23, 1989 in Fulham, London, England, to casting agent <a>Marcia Gresham</a> (née Jacobson) and literary agent <a>Alan Radcliffe</a>. His father is from aNorthern Irish Protestant background, while his mother was born inSouth Africa, to a Jewish family (from Lithuania, Poland, Russia, andGermany). Daniel began performing in small school productions as ayoung boy. Soon enough, he landed a role in<a>David Copperfield (1999)</a>,as the young David Copperfield. A couple of years later, he landed arole as Mark Pendel in<a>The Tailor of Panama (2001)</a>,the son of Harry and Louisa Pendel(<a>Geoffrey Rush</a> and<a>Jamie Lee Curtis</a>). Curtis hadindeed pointed out to Daniel's mother that he could be Harry Potterhimself. Soon afterwards, Daniel was cast as Harry Potter by director,<a>Chris Columbus</a> in the film that hittheaters in November 16, 2001,<a>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)</a>.He was recognized worldwide after this film was released. Pleasingaudiences and critics everywhere, filming on its sequel,<a>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)</a>,commenced shortly afterwards. He appeared again as Harry in<a>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)</a>directed by <a>Alfonso Cuarón</a>, and thenappeared in<a>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)</a>directed by <a>Mike Newell</a>. Shortlyafterwards, he finished filming<a>December Boys (2007)</a> in Adelaide,Australia, Kangaroo Island, and Geelong, Australia which began on the14 November 2005 and ended sometime in December. On January 27,2006, he attended the South Bank Awards Show to present the award for\"Breakthrough Artist of the Year\" to<a>Billie Piper</a>. Daniel reprised his famouscharacter once again for the next installment of the Harry Potterseries,<a>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)</a>.In February 2007, he took on his first stage role in the West End playEquus, to worldwide praise from fans and critics alike. Also that year,he starred in the television movie<a>My Boy Jack (2007)</a>, whichaired on 11 November 2007 in the UK.After voicing a character in an episode of the animated television series The Simpsons in late 2010, Radcliffe debuted as J. Pierrepont Finch in the 2011 Broadway revival How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, a role previously held by Broadway veterans Robert Morse and Matthew Broderick. Other cast members included John Larroquette, Rose Hemingway and Mary Faber.

They live in <a>The Burrow</a>, a ramshackle house of four or five stories “a little way outside” the village of <a>Ottery St. Catchpole</a> (<a>CS3</a>).</p>\n",
      "<p>For the last couple of generations, the Weasley children have all been male (Arthur, for example, is one of three brothers); Ginny Weasley, <a>born in 1981</a>, was the first girl to come along for quite some time (<a>JKR</a>). Both Molly andArthur are related to the <a>Black family</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Molly is fiercely protective of her children, but she has her hands full; the Weasleys are, almost without exception, risk-takers who courageously give their all for what they believe in (well, perhaps the twins do it from pure joy too). From the summer of 1996 on, the Weasley <a>family clock</a> has all hands pointing at “mortal peril.” Molly took it around with her from room to room.</p>\n",
      "<p>When the security of <a>Grimmauld Place</a> was compromised in the summer of 1997, the Weasley home became the new headquarters for the <a>Order of the Phoenix.</a> After <a>Scrimgeour</a>was <a>killed</a> and Death Eaters took over the Ministry, most of the Weasley family members played a role in resisting the Death Eater pogroms. Ron’s absence from Hogwarts was kept secret by using the family <a>ghoul</a> to fake a case of <a>spattergroit</a>, however, once Ron, Harry and Hermione were captured and the deception revealed, the family moved to <a>Aunt Muriel</a>‘s house nearby where it was safer (<a>DH24</a>).</p>\n",

Here's what Rowling has to say in an interview about Mafalda:</p>\n",
      "<blockquote><p><em>Q: Last time we spoke you said there'd be a Weasley cousin. It didn't appear. You've deceived me!</em>A: It got pulled. Sorry about that. What happened on Book Four, and one of the reasons why it was easily the most difficult to write, which had absolutely nothing to do with Harry being famous or me being famous, was that for the first time my plan fell down. I got halfway through and realised there was a huge gaping plot hole. The two ends just didn't meet. It was entirely my own fault: I should have had the sense to go through it very carefully before I started writing. So I had to do an enormous amount of unpicking and in the process I'm afraid the Weasley cousin disappeared.<em>Q: Will we see her again?</em>A: Possibly. I really like her as a character but it's quite a complex plot I'm dealing with so I'm not sure that she'll fit anywhere else. She'll be the \"character that might have been.\" (Nr)</p></blockquote>\n",

      "<li>Bilius was one of Arthur's 2 brothers. <em>Not canon: We don't know Bilius's surname and we don't know if Molly had more than 2 brothers. \"Uncle\" can also be an honorary name given to non-family members, though this doesn't seem likely.</em>\n",

Granted, there wasn\\'t nearly as much data to put on the iPhone yet and certainly no App Store. But you had access to the internet on a screen you could actually see it on, unlike the flip and slider phones of the time. And it could only handle 128 MB of memory. The camera was 2.0 megapixels—so,\\xa0terrible. But a phone with a camera! Holy moly!</p>\\n<div><div><div><div>\\n<div>Discover your iPhone\\'s hidden features</div>\\n<div>Get a daily tip (with screenshots and clear instructions) so you can master your iPhone in just one minute a day.</div>\\n</div></div></div></div>\\n<p>As a fun aside, there actually isn\\'t an iPhone 2. From the first iPhone,\\xa0Apple leapfrogged\\xa0right over this number to the iPhone 3G and 3GS.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 3G</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0July 11, 2008</h3>\\n<p>As far as internal specs go, the iPhone 3G wasn\\'t much different than the original iPhone. But now there was an App Store! This iPhone got its moniker for its 3G connectivity, which meant access to internet you could actually use without wanting to throw the iPhone across the room.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 3GS</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: June 19, 2009</h3>\\n<p>Apple introduced the 32 GB storage option with the iPhone 3GS, doubling it from the first iPhone. Clearly, introducing the App Store changed things quickly. Between photos, music, and apps, 16 GB just wasn\\'t going to cut it. The camera\\xa0got an upgrade to 3MP and added video recording. Apple also added Voice Control, although we’d have to wait a couple more years before the introduction of Siri.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 4</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: June 24, 2010</h3>\\n<p>Now we’re getting somewhere. The iPhone 4 was the first iPhone to have a front-facing camera. Little did Apple know, selfies would take over the world. The iPhone 4 also got a Retina display. With 512 MB of memory, it was equipped to handle a lot more than even the iPhone 3GS, which only had\\xa0256\\xa0MB of memory. You can see the technology was beginning to look a little more familiar, but 32 GB was still the maximum amount of storage the iPhone\\xa0could hold.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 4S</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0October 14, 2011</h3>\\n<p>Talk about a huge difference between the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S: the camera went from 5MP to a whopping 8MP. Now, that’s an upgrade. Apple also introduced the 64 GB storage option but kept the memory at 512 MB. Video could then be recorded in 1080p. Oh, I can’t forget—hello, Siri! Apple sold four million units of the iPhone 4S in its first week.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 5</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: September 21, 2012</h3>\\n<p>Apple sold 5 million units of the iPhone 5 in its first week. The camera stayed the same but memory was boosted all the way up to 1 GB. You thought 3G was cool? Psh, the iPhone 5 had LTE connectivity. Hello, internet everywhere! Apple also introduced the Lightning connector with the iPhone 5. And for the first time, the screen got bigger! All previous generations\\' displays\\xa0were 3.5 inches, but the iPhone 5 was 4 inches.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 5s\\xa0&amp; iPhone 5c</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: September 20, 2013</h3>\\n<p>Between the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c, Apple sold nine million units in the first week of sales. The iPhone 5c was meant to be slightly more affordable and had a plastic shell. It was available in four different colors, but not too much else was different. The iPhone 5s, on the other hand, introduced Touch ID, dual flash, and slow-motion video. Plus, it included the M7 motion coprocessor, which opened a new realm of possibilities and also helped save battery life.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 6 &amp; 6 Plus</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0September 19, 2014</h3>\\n<p>Apple tends to make larger leaps between the original model and the S edition than it does from the S edition to a new model. The iPhone 6\\'s\\xa0internal specs were very similar to those of the iPhone 5s. The biggest difference was having a significantly larger screen and offering an even larger size called 6 Plus. The Retina display became HD, and the option to get an iPhone with 128 GB of storage became available. But the amount of memory was the same, and the camera didn\\'t see a megapixel upgrade. But it didn\\'t matter—Apple sold 10 million units in the first week.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 6s\\xa0&amp; 6s\\xa0Plus</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: September 19, 2015</h3>\\n<p>The 6s changed everything. Well, not <em>everything; it</em>\\xa0basically looked\\xa0the same. But inside, Apple upgraded the iPhone 6s\\xa0quite a lot. The camera made a huge leap forward going from 8MP to 12MP. The memory was also doubled from 1 GB to 2 GB. After the iPhone 6 had\\xa0some bending issues (#bendgate), Apple gave the iPhone 6s 7000 series aluminum to make sure that never happened again. Last but not least, 3D Touch was introduced.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone SE</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0March 31, 2016</h3>\\n<p>Don’t think I’ve forgotten the iPhone SE. It had all the awesome internal specs of the iPhone 6s in a small package and without 3D Touch. But overall, the iPhone SE was introduced as a more affordable option that people really loved.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 7 &amp; 7 Plus</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0September 16, 2016</h3>\\n<p>Apple finally dropped the\\xa016 GB base model option, with iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus\\xa0base models starting at 32 GB of storage and going up to 256 GB. Apple also introduced a new shiny\\xa0Jet Black color. The iPhone 7 Plus proved to be more popular than previous Plus models due to its new dual camera, which made a significantly improved zoom feature possible, and Portrait mode, a software update that\\xa0let iPhone 7 Plus users take impressive photos using Depth of Field. Perhaps the most controversial feature of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus was the one Apple removed: the\\xa0headphone jack. The new iPhones shipped with EarPods that plugged into the Lightning port and an adapter for traditional headphones. Apple introduced its\\xa0wireless AirPods at the same event it announced it was eliminating the headphone jack. Apple stopped\\xa0supporting\\xa0updates for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus once iOS 16 launched\\xa0in September 2022.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 8 &amp; 8 Plus</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0September 22, 2017</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus introduced us to wireless charging with the glass cover on the back of the iPhone. The camera was awesome, with upgraded tools for editing and filtering our images. The true-tone display improved the viewing experience by automatically reducing blue-light exposure. Users eventually (mostly) got used to not having a headphone jack and began adapting to the wireless lifestyle.\\xa0Apple stopped\\xa0supporting\\xa0updates for the iPhone 8 line\\xa0once iOS 17\\xa0launched\\xa0in September 2023.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone X</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0November 3, 2017</h3>\\n<p>Skipping right over the iPhone 9, the iPhone X was released 10 years after the original iPhone. The iPhone X included an extra front-facing camera that let us take amazing selfies in Portrait mode. Sure, other iPhones let us take cool-looking photos, but the iPhone X included Portrait mode for the front-facing camera, and we fell in love at first aperture.\\xa0Apple stopped\\xa0supporting\\xa0updates for the iPhone X once iOS 17\\xa0launched\\xa0in September 2023.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone XS\\xa0&amp; XS Max</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0September 21, 2018</h3>\\n<p>Apple announced the XS and XS Max at its September 2018 event in the Steve Jobs Theater. These models were well named, as they were definite upgrades along the lines of the iPhone X. Both models had the front-facing camera\\xa0for Portrait-mode selfies. The displays were edge to edge, and it all looked great with the Super Retina HD display. The biggest upgrade might be the smallest; the A12 bionic chip increased the processing power while decreasing battery drain.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone XR</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0October 26, 2018</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone XR was also announced at the September 2018 event but wasn\\'t available right away. Because it was the cheaper of the new models, quite a few people decided to wait for the XR to be available. These iPhones were smaller than the XS and XS Max (but still bigger than the 7 and 8 Plus). The display was not as crisp as the XS and XS Max, but with the Liquid Retina HD display, the difference wasn\\'t too noticeable. This model also had a front-facing camera and came in way more colors than the XS or XS Max.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 11</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0September 20, 2019</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone 11 was the least expensive of Apple\\'s annual line at the time, but still had enough new features to be in the running for 2019\\'s most popular iPhone. The device features\\xa0a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display, and comes in six crisp colors. The most exciting addition may have been the second camera on the back of the 11, both 12MP, and offering wide and ultra-wide lenses.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 11 Pro</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0September 20, 2019</h3>\\n<p>For Apple customers looking for a smaller phone with a top-of-the-line display, the iPhone 11 Pro was perfect. The 5.8-inch\\xa0Super Retina XDR display was Apple\\'s\\xa0most crisp\\xa0and clear to date. This phone featured\\xa0not two, but three, 12 MP HDR camera lenses, offering wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses. The color options were more muted than the iPhone 11, but there was\\xa0always the option to add a flashy case!</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 11 Pro Max</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0September 20, 2019</h3>\\n<p>Apple\\'s largest and most expensive phone of 2019 was\\xa0the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The display was\\xa0Apple\\'s Super Retina XDR, as with the 11 Pro, but sized at 6.5-inches. The Pro Max featured\\xa0the same, three-lens camera setup as the 11 Pro, as well as the same color choices, making size nearly the only difference between the devices.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone SE (second-generation)</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: April 24, 2020</h3>\\n<p>The 2020 iPhone SE is the second of its kind and was loved by those who prefer smaller iPhones. Apple took\\xa0a few cues from the past with this throwback iPhone. The\\xa04.7-inch Retina HD display and Home button with Touch ID harken back to the original iPhone SE, and with a similarly\\xa0low price.\\xa0The second-generation SE\\xa0offered many of the features of Apple\\'s most expensive iPhones, including\\xa0an\\xa0A13 Bionic chip, advanced camera system with Portrait mode and Depth Control, high-definition video, wireless charging capability, and long battery life.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 12 mini</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: November 13, 2020</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone 12 mini was a surprisingly small but still very powerful addition to the iPhone family. This thin\\xa0and incredibly light\\xa0smartphone\\xa0measured just 5.4 inches and included the new, powerful A14 Bionic chip for a considerable boost in performance over previous models.\\xa0It also featured Apple\\'s latest Super Retina XDR OLED display and a host of camera upgrades, but still came with\\xa0a dual-lens arrangement. The only notable differences between the\\xa0iPhone 12 mini and the iPhone 12 were that the mini was smaller and had an estimated battery life that\\'s two hours shorter than that of the larger iPhone 12.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 12</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: October 23, 2020</h3>\\n<p>The 6.1-inch iPhone 12 had exactly the same features, camera specs, and processing capabilities as the 12 mini, except that it was\\xa0estimated to have a 17-hour video playback compared to the iPhone 12 mini\\'s 15 hours. This mid-range model also included the dual-lens camera,\\xa0which was\\xa0good enough for everyday users. However,\\xa0Apple did include some impressive upgrades to their higher-end iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max phones\\xa0for those who chose their iPhones for their camera capabilities,</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 12 Pro</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0October 23, 2020</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone 12 Pro boasted some very fancy\\xa0camera and color upgrades\\xa0as compared to the 12 and the 12 mini, but came in the same 6.1-inch screen size as the iPhone 12 and included all of the baseline features present in the budget models.\\xa0New camera features introduced in 2020 include a triple-lens arrangement like we saw with the iPhone 11 Pro models, but with LiDAR scanning, improved Night Mode, and enhanced zoom range and lens functions. Both iPhone 12 Pro models included the fastest aperture ever used in an iPhone.\\xa0Apple added RAW photos for superior pro editing capability and included Dolby Vision up to 60 frames per second in the Pro models.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 12 Pro Max</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date:\\xa0November 13, 2020</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone 12 Pro Max,\\xa0featured all of the benefits of the 12 Pro, but with some upgrades\\xa0and a considerable size difference. The 6.7-inch\\xa0Pro Max claimed an 87 percent improvement in the way it functions in low light over the iPhone 11 models and features 5x zoom, which was a big deal for those who use their iPhones for professional or near-professional photography projects.\\xa0The most distinguishing characteristic of this iPhone was its screen size.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 13</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: September 24, 2021</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone 13 line\\'s base model maintains many of the design features (re-)introduced in the iPhone 12 series, but it also comes with a 20 percent smaller notch, accommodated by a new camera layout. It runs on the A15 chip, which is an upgrade over the previous generation of iPhones, and the camera features some significant improvements, including <a>Cinematic mode</a> and <a>Photographic Styles</a>. Battery life is also improved for this model, and it comes in the following colors:\\xa0pink, blue, midnight, starlight, and PRODUCT(RED). A big selling point for the iPhone 13 is the price point: it starts at the same price as the iPhone 12 did when released, but its base model offers double the storage space. The screen size remains the same at 6.1 inches.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 13 mini</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: September 24, 2021</h3>\\n<p>Like its bigger siblings, the iPhone 13 mini runs on Apple\\'s A15 Bionic chip, making it a powerhouse in a small package. Its battery life has improved up to an hour and a half a day over the iPhone 12 mini. As with other iPhone 13 models, the mini features big camera improvements, and the most storage available of any mini model at a maximum storage capacity of 512 GB. Its design and physical size also largely mirror the iPhone 12 mini, clocking in with a screen size of 5.4 inches. It features the same color options as the iPhone 13 and a starting price of $699 for 128 GB.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 13 Pro</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: September 24, 2021</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone 13 Pro features a 6.1-inch\\xa0Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion, but its big draw is the inclusion of a Telephoto camera, in addition to the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras that come with the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini. It comes with\\xa0a LiDAR scanner for Night Mode photography and offers a 1 TB model for more storage than any iPhone has ever offered before. It needs it, considering all the new camera features make for pretty bulky file sizes. It is also powered by the A15 chip and comes in silver, graphite, gold, and sierra blue.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 13 Pro Max</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: September 24, 2021</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone 13 Pro Max offers everything the Pro does, but bigger. Its screen is the same size as the iPhone 12 Pro Max: 6.7 inches\\xa0diagonally. It, like the rest of the iPhone 13 line, is a bit heavier and thicker than its predecessor, despite sharing the same dimensions otherwise. In addition to getting a chip upgrade to the A15, the iPhone 13 Pro Max also gets an additional GPU, for a total of five. It, too, offers a 1 TB storage capacity option, and Apple says the battery is able to support up to 28 hours of non-stop video playback. With the heftiest price tag of any iPhone, the iPhone Pro Max is the ultimate top-of-the-line model available.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone SE (third-generation)</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: March 8, 2022</h3>\\n<p>The 2022 iPhone SE 3 is the third of its kind. It maintains the 4.7-inch\\xa0Retina HD display and Home button with Touch ID, which harken back to the original iPhone SE, and with a similarly\\xa0low price.\\xa0The third-generation SE\\xa0offers many of the features of Apple\\'s most expensive iPhones, including 5G, an\\xa0A15\\xa0Bionic chip, an advanced camera system with Portrait mode, Depth Control, high-definition video, Deep Fusion, wireless charging capability, and long battery life.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 14 &amp; 14 Plus</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: 14\\xa0- September\\xa016, 14 Plus - October 7 2022</h3>\\n<p>Instead of the iPhone mini, Apple brought the Plus back for iPhone 14, with the slightly larger display\\xa0that had been restricted to the exclusive Pro and Pro Max models in recent years. The iPhone 14\\xa0models came with some impressive safety-focused features, including Crash Detection\\xa0(which automatically detects a car wreck and contacts emergency services in the event of a crash) and\\xa0Emergency SOS via satellite, a feature with the capability to connect to emergency services via satellite if you find yourself in distress while\\xa0out of range of Wi-Fi or cellular. The Emergency SOS via satellite is a first in the smartphone arena, since connecting to a satellite was previously only possible through bulky expensive devices built specifically for this purpose. The iPhone 14 &amp; 14 Plus also offers\\xa0a new dual-camera system, designed to take\\xa0low-light photography to the next level (goodbye, grainy nighttime photos!).</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 14 Pro</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: September\\xa016, 2022</h3>\\n<p>Similar to the iPhone 14 base model, the\\xa06.1\" iPhone 14 Pro debuted with the same Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite safety features. In addition to the new A16 Bionic chip, it also got a surprising upgrade, with a new \"Dynamic Island\" feature where the notch\\xa0used to be. While\\xa0the notch isn\\'t gone, it now adapts to whatever you are doing to more seamlessly display notifications and background activities. It also featured an Always-On display, made possible by low-energy components, so that the time and widgets on your lock screen are always viewable. In perhaps the most impressive update, the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max offer a 48 MP camera (a sharp jump from the 12 MP camera offered by the previous model). This\\xa0translates to a more flexible camera, with more options for framing and cropping, as well as better low-light shots so you can worry less about the lighting and more about capturing the moment.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 14 Pro Max</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: September\\xa016, 2022</h3>\\n<p>Its screen is the same size as the previous Pro Max generation: 6.7 inches\\xa0diagonally.\\xa0As expected, the iPhone 14 Pro Max has the same upgrades the other iPhone 14 models had, including the Always-On display, Dynamic Island, A16 chip, Emergency SOS via Satellite, Crash Detection, and the impressive 48 MP camera. It also offered a staggering 29-hour video playback battery life and the brightest and clearest display of any iPhone ever. With the new 48 MP camera, you won\\'t want to stop taking photos, as this camera helps you to capture more colors, textures, and detail than ever before!</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 15 &amp; 15 Plus</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: September 12, 2023</h3>\\n<p>The new iPhone 15 and 15 Plus were recently unveiled at Apple\\'s\\xa0September 12\\xa0event. These models feature the same 6.1 and 6.7\" Super Retina XDR displays as the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus, but the 15 and 15 Plus come with a new feature: color-infused glass backs. The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus have also added the Dynamic Island, only available in the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max last year. Both models feature\\xa0a USB-C, rather than a Lighting port.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus also have a chip upgrade,\\xa0moving up to the A16 Bionic Chip. The Advanced dual-camera system now features 48MP, Super-high-res photos, and Next-gen portraits with Focus and Depth control on both models. Also\\xa0included are important safety features like\\xa0Crash Detection\\xa0and\\xa0Emergency SOS via satellite.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 15\\xa0Pro</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: September 12, 2023</h3>\\n<p>The new iPhone 15\\xa0Pro\\xa0was\\xa0recently unveiled at Apple\\'s\\xa0September 12\\xa0event.\\xa0New features of Apple\\'s latest iPhone model include a titanium frame, USB-C port, and the brand new Action button. The Action button turns the Ring/Silent switch into a customizable button that can\\xa0activate\\xa0the camera, turn\\xa0on the flashlight, set Accesibility options, change Focus modes, open a note, start\\xa0a Voice Memo,\\xa0and even run\\xa0custom Shortcuts.</p>\\n<p>Similar to the iPhone 15\\xa0base model, the\\xa06.1\" iPhone 15\\xa0Pro offers Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via satellite safety features. The new A17 Pro Bionic chip allows for the best iPhone graphics performance to date (great for gaming), while the camera system\\xa0now features next-generation portraits with Focus and Depth Control.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 15\\xa0Pro Max</h2>\\n<h3>Release Date: September 12, 2023</h3>\\n<p>The new iPhone 15 Pro Max was unveiled at Apple\\'s\\xa0September 12\\xa0event. Just like the 15 Pro, the\\xa06.7\" iPhone 15\\xa0Pro Max includes\\xa0a titanium frame, USB-C port, and Action button. The Pro Max also offers safety features, including Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via satellite safety features. The A17 Pro Bionic chip combined with its larger screen size allows for the best iPhone gaming performance to date, with less lag, more speed, and immersive, detailed graphics. The camera system now features next-generation portraits with Focus and Depth Control.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone Generations to Come</h2>\\n<p>Apple has released a total of 38\\xa0iPhones over the years (including the latest\\xa0iPhone 15\\xa0models).\\xa0We\\'ve given you a complete look at each iPhone evolution,\\xa0starting when Steve Jobs unveiled the original iPhone in 2007. As you can see, the iPhone has gone through a lot of changes, from a 16 GB web browser to a 1 TB all-in-one camera, workspace, and entertainment center.</p>\\n<p>In the early days, Apple released one iPhone per year. That gradually changed as the releases of new models got closer and closer together from 2010 to 2013. With the September rollout, though, Apple released both the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c, ushering in an era of two iPhone releases per year. 2017, 2018, and 2019 each saw the release of three more iPhone models, and then in 2020 the tech giant shocked the world. Not only did it release the iPhone SE (second-generation) in April, the company also rolled out the four iPhones in the 12-series lineup in its\\xa0delayed fall announcement.</p>\\n<p>At its September 2021\\xa0event, Apple\\xa0revealed the four new phones that comprise the iPhone 13 lineup,\\xa0then in March 2022 released the\\xa0the iPhone SE (third-generation). However, in the September 2022 event, the iPhone 14 lineup had reverted to only three new phones, marking the end of the less popular iPhone mini. Apple\\xa0released the exciting new iPhone 15 in September 2023 and moved back to the four-iPhone lineup, minus the mini.</p>\\n<p>We loved learning about the history of the iPhone over the years, and we hope you did, too!

The app is the largest bait and switch I’ve ever seen.  Which leads me to believe that they’re paying for people to post positive reviews.  Because there is zero percent chance anyone who used it for longer than 5 minutes would ever have a positive thing to say about it. This app is a total scam.  I was having fun with the free app so I decided to upgrade to lifetime premium for what was supposedly a discounted price.  Moments later my card was charge for $37 and change.  Ok well maybe it’ll be worth it if it works well and at least I have it for life.  NOPE.  Thing is useless you’d have much better luck with literally any other AI app.</p></blockquote>\\n</div></div>\\n<div><div>\\n<div>\\n<span>r i y a h 🔥</span><span>,</span><time>03/15/2024</time>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Do not buy. EVER.</h3>\\n<blockquote><p>I don’t even want a refund. The developers obviously need the money due to the ineffectiveness of this app. I spent $30 on premium as I’m a highschool student who’s in charge of making funny advertisements for my clubs. A few months ago I used this app to do the exact thing and it seems to work perfectly fine (so I assumed it would be work lol). I went ahead and spent $30 for the lifetime one time charge and was immediately charged $30 on one card and an attempt to double charge me for $32 on another card (it was my Apple Pay and I’m so glad I never put money on that one lol). I then had a 2 hour battle with customer service through email to even receive all the characters. Then to my surprise (not really), I attempted to make multiple videos for hours and I can’t even make one. Right now, it seems like the singing feature is the ONLY THING THAT WORKS. I literally don’t need that. I’m going to keep on checking on it over the days to see if maybe developers will update it or something will be done but this is a big disappointment. I was so tempted to just delete and redownload the app but after reading the other reviews, I realize that if I do that I just might lose my premium all together. $30 is pretty significant for a broke teenager like myself but I’m more mad about it not working at all. Even if you contact customer service, they can’t change somethings that’s completely the develops fault. Fix your app, this is ridiculous.</p></blockquote>\\n</div></div>\\n<div><div>\\n<div>\\n<span>BenzBabt860</span><span>,</span><time>04/26/2024</time>\\n</div>\\n<h3>At first glance</h3>\\n<blockquote><p>I’ll begin by saying overall the app doesn’t seem too too bad. At first glance I thought sure I’ll hop on and see what it is, this seems like something that might be fun right? So here I go I get the app I of course pay for what seems to be the better choice, a lifetime subscription for minimal price. after downloading the app of course I’m like a kid in the Candy store. I wanna play around with the app and create different voices. Different things work perfectly at first for the first 24/ 48 hours even. After that I was going to have a couple of my friends download the app as well, because I figured it’d be fun. We all would do it and create different things especially using them in our messages lo and behold I go in to show another friend and I had 12 failed attempts to download the video, not to mention download  wouldn’t even load it would go through and then say video fail. I did contact the company and hopefully I’ll get a response if I don’t, I will be downgrading my review like I said a few of them worked in the beginning, but then stopped, I thought maybe it was the character that was using, but nope I tried different characters as well. So let’s see what the developers come up with as a solution, btw it isn’t my phone or WiFi causing the issue.</p></blockquote>\\n</div></div>\\n</div></section><section><div><h2>App Privacy</h2></div>\\n<p>The developer, <span>parrot ai</span>, indicated that the app’s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

Imagine, the year 2007: no one owned an iPhone and the term “selfie” wasn’t even a twinkle in a future Instagrammer’s eye. Let’s take a walk down memory lane and learn what made the first iPhone\\xa0the household name it is today.</p>\\n<h2>The Smartphone Landscape Pre-iPhone</h2>\\n<p>The iPhone was not the first smartphone: that honor goes to <a>IBM’s Simon Personal Communicator</a><a>,</a> which was released all the way back in 1994. This early smartphone included a touchscreen and could send and receive faxes and emails (primarily entreaties for help from a Nigerian prince).</p>\\n<p>In the 2000s, prior to the iPhone’s debut, <a>the smartphone landscape was dominated by devices like the BlackBerry and Motorola RAZR</a>, which featured external keyboards and smaller screens. Other competitors like the <a>Nokia N95</a> and <a>HTC Touch</a> matched or even surpassed the original iPhone in some areas but failed to capture the zeitgeist in the way Apple’s phone did.</p>\\n<div><div><div><div>\\n<div>Discover your iPhone's hidden features</div>\\n<div>Get a daily tip (with screenshots and clear instructions) so you can master your iPhone in just one minute a day.</div>\\n</div></div></div></div>\\n<p>You might be surprised to know that the iPhone was not Apple’s first foray into cellphone technology. That dubious honor goes to the <a>ROKR E1</a>, a 2005 collaboration with Motorola that dissatisfied consumers and then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs alike.</p>\\n<p><strong><em>Related:\\xa0<a>The Evolution of the iPhone: Every Model from 2007–2020</a></em></strong></p>\\n<h2>The First iPhone Launch</h2>\\n<p>In 2003, <a>Apple began work on Project Purple</a>, the internal initiative that would eventually produce the first iPhone. That’s right, Apple began ideation before their disastrous collaboration with Motorola, though the failure of the ROKR E1 may have been what convinced Apple to produce their own phone in order to get the product they wanted.</p>\\n<p>Four years later on January 9, 2007, <a>Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone in his Macworld keynote address</a>. For the public release on June 29, 2007, <a>eager customers lined up around Apple stores</a> for a chance to snag one of the highly anticipated devices.</p>\\n<p>Not everyone was queuing up to give Apple accolades. <a>TechCrunch predicted, just weeks before its debut, that the iPhone was doomed to fail</a>. Then-CEO of Microsoft, <a>Steve Ballmer, laughed at at the iPhone’s exorbitant price point and lack of a physical keyboard</a> (don’t worry, we’ll talk about that later), saying it wouldn’t appeal to businesspeople (who were the key smartphone demographic at the time).</p>\\n<p>Ballmer likely wasn’t laughing quite so heartily as sales numbers and reviews began to come in. By and large, <a>people liked the touchscreen user interface, sleek design, and the way it successfully combined an iPod and a phone</a>. Other reviewers praised the first iPhone for its ease of use. What people didn’t like was that in order to get a working iPhone, users were locked into a two-year contract with AT&amp;T and forced to use the 2G EDGE network, which was notoriously slow and spotty. <a>Neither were they big fans of the price tag or the way the screen collected fingerprints like Easter eggs</a>.</p>\\n<p>None of that stopped Apple from moving <a>1.39 million units in the latter half of 2007</a>. The new phone that everyone was clamoring for seems meager by today’s standards: customers could choose between an 8-gigabyte model for $599 or a 4 GB model for $499. I couldn’t even fit half the videos of my dog on that! But that would not have been a concern, since you could not record video on the first iPhone. Maybe it was for the best: the original iPhone only had a 2-megapixel camera (compare that with the iPhone 12’s 12-megapixel primary camera).\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Today, it’s easy to forget the internal landscape at Apple that the first iPhone was born into. Back then, Apple’s hottest product was undoubtedly the iPod. <a>Launched in October 2001, it was built around iTunes</a>, which had debuted in January of that year. If you were around back then, you probably remember iPod commercials: black silhouettes dancing on bright backgrounds, stark white iPods clutched in their hands, white earbud wires twirling with them. The iPod made Apple stylish, and in another world, we may have gotten an iPhone designed much like the iPod, complete with its signature scroll wheel. That was the first design pursued by Apple’s Project Purple; it was rejected and later lambasted by Jobs in his Macworld address unveiling the iPhone.</p>\\n<p>Though the iPod look wouldn’t make it onto the first iPhone, one thing the devices had in common was reliance on iTunes. Today, your iPhone can go through its whole lifecycle without once being plugged into a computer, if you so desire. But back in 2007, <a>if you wanted any of the music, movies, and TV shows you had stored in iTunes on your iPhone, you’d need to plug in and sync up</a>.</p>\\n<p>But make no mistake, for 2007, the first iPhone was the real deal, offering many new technologies not before seen on the smartphone market.</p>\\n<h2>What Was Special About the First iPhone?</h2>\\n<p>The first iPhone was indeed groundbreaking in many ways. Unlike earlier smartphones, it included a bevy of new features, including a multitouch interface, a soft keyboard, and visual voicemail. It also offered a feature we’ve all come to know and love (while being occasionally frustrated by): the accelerometer, which is what allows you to switch back and forth between landscape and portrait mode on your phone. To learn more about special iPhone features like the accelerometer, consider signing up for our free\\xa0<a>Tip of the Day</a> newsletter.</p>\\n<p>The first iPhone’s soft keyboard was perhaps its most revolutionary feature at the time. Other popular smartphones of the mid-2000s, like the BlackBerry, were dominated by keyboards with physical buttons that people would use to type and navigate their screens. Physical keyboards took up nearly half of the phone, forcing designers to squeeze the user interface into small, crowded screens.</p>\\n<p>Apple wanted nothing to do with the limitations inherent in a physical keyboard. Though there is some disagreement on who first had the idea to build a touchscreen phone, Apple diverted resources from its prototype touchscreen tablet dubbed Model 035 to begin work on a touchscreen mobile phone. The engineers quickly ran into a problem, though: the buttons on the soft keyboard were so small that accuracy was a big challenge. <a>Former Apple executive Scott Forstall stopped work on other aspects of the phone and tasked all his user interface developers with developing a better soft keyboard</a>. Eventually, an unnamed engineer landed on technology that used artificial intelligence to predict what letter users would type next.</p>\\n<p>With this technology, Apple had developed an accurate keyboard built right into a touchscreen smartphone. Because they didn’t need to build a hard keyboard, they were able to make the screen bigger. As Growth Marketer and Freelance Tech Writer Nelson Jordan puts it, “Removing the physical keyboards [...] opened the door to much bigger screens, which in turn changed how we used our phones. They weren't just for talk, text, and email anymore. They were for games, videos, and entertainment. Indeed, that's how we use them the vast majority of the time today.”</p>\\n<p>You might be surprised to learn that the first iPhone did not include the App Store. Though today it’s hard to imagine our iPhones without a veritable smorgasbord of apps, <a>Steve Jobs was not wild about the idea of ceding any control over the device to third parties</a>. It’s a good thing Apple came around on that—just imagine all the fancy brunches that would have gone undocumented on Instagram!</p>\\n<p>Other novel technologies debuted with the first iPhone were a proximity sensor that prevented unwanted screen interaction when holding your phone to your when on calls, and an ambient light sensor, which adjusted screen brightness based on your surroundings. Both features remain with the iPhone today.</p>\\n<p>From the very beginning, the iPhone differed from its competitors by using Safari for web browsing, which allowed the first iPhone to display web pages closer to how they would appear on a desktop.</p>\\n<p>All these features: the touchscreen, the soft keyboard, the accelerometer, mobile Safari, and more were designed with ease of use in mind. Though the first iPhone eschewed features other smartphones of the time offered, like 3G and MMS, its focus on user experience put it head and shoulders above its competitors. Undoubtedly, this focus on user experience paid off.</p>\\n<p>Since its launch in 2007, <a>the iPhone has gone through an incredible twenty iterations</a>. Some have been more popular than others, but the iPhone line has been wildly successful by any measure. Indeed, it’s hard to think of smartphones at all without thinking of the iPhone. Though one can hardly call the iPhone’s beginnings humble, the strides taken in just 14 years are nothing to sneeze at. So, next time you take a panoramic video with your 12-megapixel camera, edit it with a third-party app from the App Store, and send it out to all your friends over your 5G connection, spare a thought for a time in which it was a cool party trick just to pull out your first-generation iPhone and turn it sideways to show off the accelerometer’s landscape orientation.</p>\\n<p><em>Top image credit: nyker / Shutterstock.com</em></p>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<span><em>Master your iPhone in one minute a day: <a>Sign up here</a> to get our FREE Tip of the Day delivered right to your inbox.</em></span><div>\\n<h3><span>Topics</span></h3>\\n<div><div><div><a>Opinion</a></div></div></div>\\n<div><div><div><a>iPhone</a></div></div></div>\\n</div>\\n</div></article><div><div>\\n<div><div><div>\\n<div> <span><div>\\n<h4>Author Details</h4>\\n<div>\\n<h4>Author Details</h4>\\n<h5><a>Elisabeth Garry</a></h5>\\n</div>\\n</div></span> </div>\\n<div> <div>\\n<p>Elisabeth Garry is an Associate Editor for iPhone Life.

Its marketing likes to emphasize this point often as a way of distinguishing the company from its competitors.</p>\\n<p>Interestingly though, a new discovery reveals that the just-released M4 iPad Pro includes a new security feature that Apple hasn’t told anyone about.</p>\\n<h2>Your microphone and camera indicators are more secure</h2>\\n<p>As discovered by Guilherme Rambo, Apple’s M4 iPad Pro comes with a security enhancement that relates to the microphone and camera light indicators.</p>\\n<p><a>Rambo writes on Mastodon</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Fun fact about the M4 iPad Pro: it’s the first device to support and use Apple’s new Secure Indicator Light (SIL) mechanism. When using the microphone or camera, the corresponding indicator dot is effectively rendered in hardware, making it a lot less likely that any malware or user space app would be able to access those sensors without the user’s knowledge.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Apple first introduced the microphone and camera light indicators—the little orange and green dots that appear when those sensors are in use—<a>back in fall 2020</a> with iOS 14. </p>\\n<p>These indicators were intended to increase user awareness of when an app might be listening in or taking video, all in an effort to dissuade bad actors from leveraging an iPhone’s hardware without user consent.</p>\\n<p>While those indicators historically have been tied to software triggers, the new Secure Indicator Light of the M4 iPad Pro appears to make the system even more secure by tying its control to hardware components.</p>\\n<h2>New feature made possible by Secure Exclave</h2>\\n<p>Rambo first uncovered the existence of a new ‘Secure Exclave’ as part of the M4 chip <a>a couple weeks ago</a>, but until today it was unclear what all this security component made possible. Now, it seems, one function at least is to prevent any tampering from happening with the microphone and camera indicator lights. Thus ensuring they work as intended and no malicious apps can circumvent them.</p>\\n<p>Currently the new iPad Pro is the only device to contain this new security protocol, but it will almost certainly make its way to the iPhone 16 Pro’s A18 chip and to M4 Mac models later this year.</p>\\n<p>In the meantime, perhaps Apple isn’t mentioning the feature publicly because it would indicate, inadvertently, that the existing microphone and camera indicators in all other hardware aren’t as secure as they could be.</p>\\n<div><a><em>Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.</em></a></div>\\n<div><p><em>FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.</em> <a>More.</a></p></div>\\n<div><div>You’re reading 9to5Mac — experts who break news about Apple and its surrounding ecosystem, day after day.

Billions of people use them every day. But what were the phones that started it all? Let’s take a look back at the history of mobile phones…</strong></p> <p>A LOT can happen in 40 years. But when it comes to technology, 40-years is like going back to the days of Moses or the Roman Empire. Case in point: the mobile phone –– and, more recently, the rise of mobile internet communications, social networks, and super-fast internet.</p> <p>It was a long road getting here, but now we live in a world where our phones are more powerful than some laptops! It’s crazy when you think about it, right? I mean, <a><strong>half of the phones inside our Best Android Phone Guide</strong></a> have more RAM than my mum’s laptop! <a><strong>You now have 5G to consider</strong></a> too.</p> <p>But what were the phones that made it happen? How did we get from the <a><strong>Nokia 3310</strong></a> to <a><strong>the iPhone 5s (the world’s first 64-bit smartphone)</strong></a>? Who were the pioneering brands that made today’s handsets possible? And which phone, out of the thousands launched since the 1980s, was the most important? Answer: there have been quite a few.</p> <p>But first: a history lesson.</p> <h2><strong>History of Mobile Phones</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <h2><strong>The First Cell Phone…</strong></h2> <p><strong>The world’s first mobile phone call was made on April 3, 1973</strong>, when Martin Cooper, a senior engineer at <a>Motorola</a>, called a rival telecommunications company and informed them he was speaking via a mobile phone. </p> <p>The phone Cooper used – if you could call it that – weighed a staggering 1.1kg and measured in at 228.6x127x44.4mm. With this prototype device, you got 30 minutes of talk-time and it took around 10 hours to charge.</p> <p>However, the concept of smartphones was first <a><strong>envisaged by Nikola Tesla WAY back in 1926</strong></a> – he basically predicted iPhones, the internet, and our modern telecommunication-powered world.</p> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <h2><strong>First Portable Phone</strong></h2> <p>In 1983, <a>Motorola released its first commercial mobile phone</a>, known as the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X. The handset offered 30 minutes of\\xa0talk-time, six hours standby, and could <a>store 30 phone numbers</a>. It also cost £2639 ($3995).</p> <p>In the very early days of the mobile space, handsets weren’t designed with consumers in mind. You’d need a couple of thousand pounds to get hold of one, and even then performance wasn’t great.</p> <p>Back then, mobile phones were designed with the likes of Gordon Gecko in mind, businessmen-types that drove big Jags and flew Concord. Not your average Joe. And these phones weren’t what you’d consider “portable” either.</p> <p>Even at the start of the 1990s, this was still the case despite Nokia and NEC entering the fray. Nokia’s first ‘handheld’ mobile phone, the Mobira Cityman 900, launched in 1989 and weighed just 800g – a huge improvement over 1982’s 9.8kg Mobira Senator model.</p> <p>1990 to 1995 represented an upward swerve in design and portability, with mobile devices (cell phones) gradually starting to appear in the hands of average consumers for the first time.</p> <h2><strong>When Did Flip Phones Come Out?</strong></h2> <p>Of all the major innovations back in the early days of cell phones, it was perhaps the advent of flip phones that had the biggest impact on consumers.</p> <p>The first flip phone to come out was the Motorola StarTAC; it was released in 1996 and, thanks to its small and portable size, was one of the most popular cell phones of its time.</p> <p>In fact, the Motorola StarTAC was so popular it was placed in the number six spot on PC World’s Greatest Gadgets of The Past 50 Years. During its time on market, Motorola shifted around 60 million StarTAC phones, making it one of the most popular early cellphones by a mile.</p> <h2><strong>When Was The Flip Phone Invented?</strong></h2> <p>The first actual flip phone, however, was invented in 1989. It was called the MicroTAC, and it was the direct predecessor to Motorola’s StarTAC phone.</p> <p>The MicroTAC featured a semi-clamshell design, whereby the mouthpiece portion of the phone would “flip” down when the user was taking or making a call. Unlike the StarTAC, its buttons and screen were still displayed when, hence the term “semi-clamshell” design.</p> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>The MicroTAC was a Motorola phone too, and it picked up where the Motorola DynaTAC left off, shaving off pounds in weight and featuring a vastly more futuristic design. But the Motorola DynaTAC was an important step towards the world’s first flip/clamshell phone.</p> <p>Without the Motorola DynaTAC and the MicroTAC, we wouldn’t have had the StarTAC. And without the StarTAC, the idea and popularity of cellphones might never have caught on with consumers, so, yes, we do owe a lot to Motorola and its innovative ways back in the early 1990s.</p> <p>Keep in mind that these phones were not cheap, either –\\xa0even by today’s standards. The MicroTAC, for instance, <strong>retailed for over $2000</strong> when it first came out.</p> <h2><strong>First Nokia Cell Phone</strong></h2> <p>You can’t really talk about cell phones without mentioning Nokia because, well, without Nokia, we probably wouldn’t have much a phone market today.</p> <p>And Nokia’s role in the growth of the cell phone market really cannot be understated. Neither can its rapid rise as a company, especially given its chequered and rather gloomy history.</p> <p>For instance, in 1996, Nokia’s revenue was around $6.5 billion. Most of it derived from the company’s sole focus: telecommunications. By 2001, Nokia’s revenue had jumped to a staggering $31 billion. Between 2001 and 2012, Nokia was the biggest phone maker on the planet.</p> <p>As for Nokia’s first cell phone, that’d be the Mobira Cityman 900. Released in 1987, the Cityman 900 was developed and released in conjunction with Mobira. The phone weighed 760g and measured in at 183 × 43 × 79\\xa0mm –\\xa0it was a hulking monster.</p> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>In Finland, Nokia’s native market, the Mobira Cityman 900 was often referred to as the “Gorba” because Mikhail Gorbachev, the then General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, was fond on using one to take his calls.</p> <p>The Gorba was a monster of a phone though, weighing a ton. And it was only designed to work on the NMT 900 network. The Mobira Cityman 900 also made its Hollywood debut in 1987’s Lethal Weapon too, where it can be seen in use in several scenes.</p> <p>The Mobira Cityman 900 was the first Nokia phone, but it was not the phone that Nokia built its empire on. The most popular Nokia phones were yet to come. And these phones were tiny in comparison to the Mobira Cityman 900 –\\xa0orders of magnitude smaller.</p> <p>And once cell phones, notably Nokia cell phones, became truly portable –\\xa0meaning, they’d fit in your jeans pocket –\\xa0this was when things really took off.</p> <p>Starting in and around 1992 with the release of Nokia’s first mass-produced phone, Nokia 1011 which could send and receive SMS messages, make calls, and store up to 99 phone numbers, things really started to take off with cell phone adoption.</p> <p>And Nokia’s supplychain was their to meet demand; it produced and designed new cell phones at a dizzying rate, generating tens of millions of sales per quarter. And this trend continued from the early 1990s right up the release of the first iPhone and the first Android phones.</p> <p>By the late-1990s, mobile devices were fast becoming the norm thanks to the following handsets…</p> <h2><strong>1989 – MOTOROLA MICROTAC 9800X</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>The Motorola MicroTAC had a pretty long shelf life; it was first introduced in 1989, but then went through a few changes that moved it from an analog phone to a GDM-compatible handset in 1994.</p> <p>It was eventually succeeded by Motorola’s StarTAC in 1996, which was one of the first “true” mobile-capable phones ever released.</p> <h2><strong>1992 – MOTOROLA INTERNATIONAL 3200</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>The Motorola International 3200 was the world’s first digital mobile phone. Like the StarTAC, it was GSM compatible. However, it was never certified, so it could be officially linked to a mobile network.</p> <p>The phone itself, which is still available in some places, as a collector’s item, will actually work on the 900MHz network. You’ll just have to track one down, and that will probably be pretty tricky (and kinda expensive too!).</p> <h2><strong>1992 – NOKIA 1011</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>The <a>Nokia 1011</a> was the world’s first mass-produced mobile phone. It could store 99 numbers and was originally released in November 1992.</p> <p>Because of the technology inside the phone, the price of the Nokia 1011 was exceptionally high – around €1796 in today’s money! That’s almost as much as the <a><strong>Samsung Galaxy Fold</strong></a> – a phone that folds and has laptop-grade specs!</p> <p>The Nokia 1011 was able to send and receive SMS messages, making it the world’s first SMS-capable phone.</p> <h2><strong>1993 – BELLSOUTH/IBM SIMON PERSONAL COMMUNICATOR</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>The IBM Simon was built by IBM and was one of the first instances of a head held, touchscreen device. Originally released in 1994, the IBM Simon went on to sell around 50,000 units total, between 1994 and 1995.</p> <p>The battery on this bad boy, however, only lasted an hour! And you thought your iPhone was bad…</p> <h2><strong>1996 – Nokia 8810 (AKA: “The Matrix Phone”)</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>The Nokia 8810 was designed to be the most luxurious phone of all time. Nokia pulled out all the stops with this one, adding in the world’s first internal antenna and support for 250 contacts.</p> <p>The 8810 would also connect to early 2G <a>networks, and it was also the phone used by Neo’s crew in the blockbuster film, The Matrix</a>, making it a true classic in every sense of the word.</p> <h2><strong>1996 – NOKIA 9000 COMMUNICATOR</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>The Nokia Communicator 9000 is basically the world’s first smartphone, as it ran on an Intel 24 MHz 1386 CPU and also had 8MB of RAM. It was heavy too, and it had a <a>full QWERTY keyboard</a>.</p> <p>It could do email, texts and make calls –\\xa0three things that hardly any of the competition could manage in the mid-90s.</p> <p>The Nokia Communicator cost £1000 when it was first released in the UK.</p> <h2><strong>1997 –\\xa0Nokia 6110</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>The Nokia 6110 was the first mobile phone to use an ARM processor and was just one of a long line of 6xxx series phones from the Finnish company.</p> <p>The handset was targeted at the consumer market and featured things like improved call-quality and extended battery life. It was also the first phone with an advanced user interface, a feature that would soon become standard.</p> <p><strong>Nokia 6110 Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Three games: Memory, Snake, Logic</strong></li> <li><strong>Calculator, clock\\xa0and\\xa0calendar</strong></li> <li><strong>Currency converter</strong></li> <li><strong>Works as a pager</strong></li> <li><strong>Profile settings</strong></li> <li><strong>4\\xa0colours</strong></li> </ul> <h2><strong>1997 – Motorola StarTAC</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>Inspired by the communicator from Star Trek, this bad boy was the world’s first clamshell handset. Another first for Motorola.</p> <h2><strong>1998 – Nokia 5110</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>Excellent battery, slim by 1998’s standards, and it also featured Snake. What more could a 90s consumer want? Interestingly, this was the first mobile phone I ever owned. I think I was in year nine at school when it came out. At the time, pretty much everybody in my year at school had this device.</p> <p><strong>Nokia 5110 Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Dimensions: 48 x 132 x 31 mm</strong></li> <li><strong>Battery: 900 mAh NiMH</strong></li> <li><strong>Display: 47 x 84 B/W</strong></li> </ul> <h2><strong>1998 – NOKIA 9110I</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>The Nokia 9210i was the successor model to the Nokia 9000 Communicator and it featured a TFT color display, a 32-bit ARM processor and the first instance of Symbian OS on a mobile phone.</p> <p>The handset was used by Val Kilmer in 1997’s remake of The Saint, as well as Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock in Bad Company.</p> <h2><strong>1999 – BlackBerry 850</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>The <a>BlackBerry 850 was the first handset released under the BlackBerry brand</a>. Ten years later, RIM would be crowned the fastest-growing company on the planet. And we all know what happened post-2010 as Apple and Android arrived on the scene. <a><strong>BlackBerry’s fall from grace</strong></a> is perhaps the saddest thing I have witnessed in my years as a tech journalist. The company, once so influential, now doesn’t even make its own phones. Tragic, really…</p> <h2><strong>2000 – Nokia 3310</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>The phone that all of your mates had at school – if you went to school in the mid-to-late-90s, that is. Even in 2013, many\\xa0regard\\xa0the 3310 as one of the best mobile devices ever created. Some even say it’s indestructible.</p> <h2><strong>2002 – Samsung SGH-T100</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>Before Samsung took over the world it made handsets like this, which was the first phone ever to use a thin-film transistor active-matrix LCD display.</p> <h2><strong>2003 – BlackBerry 5810</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>It didn’t have a built-in speaker so you had to plug headphones in to make phone calls, but <a>the BlackBerry 5810</a> did have email and a QWERTY keyboard.</p> <h2><strong>2003 – NOKIA 1100</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>Over 250 MILLION Nokia 1100s were sold during its time on the market, making it one of the most successful phone releases of all time. Even by today’s standards.</p> <p>The Nokia 1100 was designed to be basic; it didn’t feature a lot of the fancy stuff other Nokia phones had, and this made it very attractive to more basic users.</p> <p>The Nokia 1100 was officially developed for emerging countries like Nigeria and India.</p> <p>Nokia’s one billionth phone was sold in 2005, as a result of this handset’s release.</p> <h2><strong>2003 – NOKIA N-GAGE</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>The Nokia N-GAGE was the first-ever “gaming phone”. It ran on Symbian and featured a rather unique design, whereby the keys were set out on the side of the display.</p> <p>The phone was designed in an attempt to lure away <a>gamers from Nintendo’s Game Boy Advanced</a>. The handset also included support for apps and also MP3, making it a true smartphone in every sense of the word.</p> <p>On sale between 2003 and 2005, Nokia sold about three million units of this device.</p> <h2><strong>2003 – PALM ONE TREO 600</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>The TREO 600 was probably the world’s first smartphone, as it actually allowed for multi-tasking; you could check the calendar while making a call, for instance.</p> <p>The result of this phone saw the formation of Palm as a company too, following the merger of Handspring and PalmOne into Palm Inc.</p> <h2><strong>2004 – Motorola Razr V3</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p><a>Motorola</a> shifted over 130 million of its ‘fashion’ phone between the years 2004 and 2006, making it the best-selling clamshell handset in history.</p> <h2><strong>2005 – BlackBerry 7270</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>First <a>BlackBerry handset</a> to feature Wi-Fi, and one of the main reasons for widespread CrackBerry addiction.</p> <p>Miss QWERTY phones? <a><strong>Check out the Titan Pocket</strong></a>!</p> <h2><strong>2006 – Nokia N95</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>A true smartphone, one that ran on Symbian, packed in a 332MHz Texas Instruments CPU, and feature 160MB of RAM. It also featured a decent 5-megapixel camera, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. I had one of these while I was at university but, unfortunately, I ended up losing it at Glastonbury 2008.</p> <h2><strong>2007 – LG Shine</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p><strong>LG Shine Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Dimensions: 99.8 x 50.6 x 13.8mm</li> <li>Weight: 118g</li> <li>Operating system: Java MIDP 2.0</li> <li>CPU: ARM9 115 MHz</li> <li>Memory: 50 MB Internal, microSD (TransFlash) external memory card slot</li> <li>Battery: 800mAh Li-Ion</li> <li>Display: 240 x 320, 2.2-inch Display 262K-color TFT LCD</li> <li>Camera: 2.0 megapixels + Autofocus</li> </ul> <h2><strong>2008 – Apple iPhone 3G</strong></h2> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>This one needs no introduction and is largely responsible for changing the face of the mobile space forever. Apple’s iPhone popularised applications with millions of consumers, helped make touchscreen interfaces the norm, and broke new ground for overall design and finish.</p> <p>The iPhone 3G was the sharpest tip of the mobile stick, but from here on out things would begin progressing even faster.</p> <h2><strong>2010 to 2021: The Android &amp; iPhone Era</strong></h2> <p>A lot of things happened in the phone market during 2010 and 2021. The first and most obvious thing was the rise of Google’s Android platform; it went from a relative newbie in 2009 to the world’s biggest mobile phone operating system by 2013, destroying the previously dominant operating systems in the form of Symbian, <a>BlackBerry</a>, and Windows.</p> <p>Symbian kind of died a death in a relatively short period of time, a death that coincided with the death of Nokia. The two things were related too; Android and iPhones did things differently. People liked how they did things, so more and more people moved away from Symbian.</p> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></figure> <p>Nokia died. Then came <strong><a>BlackBerry’s slow and painful death</a></strong>. The company’s refusal to adapt to changing market conditions combined with people adjusting to new form factors for phones, as well as things like apps becoming a thing, killed BlackBerry’s market share within the space of a few years.</p> <p>The company held on, pushed new phones out, but as more and more people <a>migrated away from BBM to WhatsApp, and Apple’s iPhone grew in prominence, BlackBerry’s days as a player in the phone space were over</a>. The company’s last-ditch attempt to revive its fortunes was a brand new operating, BlackBerry 10, which fell flat on its face.</p> <p>BlackBerry eventually yielded to market demands and incorporated Android into its phones but by this point, it had zero appeal with consumers. People had moved on, either to Apple or Samsung. BlackBerry flailed around for a bit then called it quits, switching to a licensing deal for its brand which was <a>first undertaken by TCL</a>.</p> <p>Onward Mobility now has the BlackBerry license and has claimed it will release <strong><a>the first 5G BlackBerry phone</a></strong> at some point during 2021.</p> <p>We also lost a lot of other brands between 2010 and 2020. HTC died a pretty spectacular death, and so too did LG, one of the longest-standing <a>phone brands</a> in the Android ecosystem. Huawei grew rapidly, almost catching Apple and Samsung, but was eventually knee-capped by the US government, losing nearly all of its market share in the space of 24 months.</p> <figure><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span><figcaption>RealMe 8 Pro</figcaption></figure> <p>Apple and Samsung now dominate the phone space. But it is smaller brands like <strong><a>OPPO</a></strong>, <strong><a>Xiaomi</a></strong>, <strong><a>RealMe</a></strong>, and <strong><a>VIVO</a></strong> that are growing the fastest. And this means, by 2023 or 2023, the biggest phone brand on the planet will probably no longer be Samsung and Apple. It will be a <a>Chinese phone brand</a>. <strong><a>Most likely one owned by BBK</a></strong>, so either OPPO, VIVO, or RealMe.</p> <p>I wonder how things will change between 2020 and 2030?</p> <div><div>\\n<a><span><span><span>X</span></span></span></a><a><span><span><span>Facebook</span></span></span></a><a><span><span><span>LinkedIn</span></span></span></a><a><span><span><span>Email</span></span></span></a><a><span><span><span>Messenger</span></span></span></a><a><span><span><span>Mix</span></span></span></a><a><span><span><span>164</span></span><span><span>Pinterest</span></span></span></a><a><span><span><span>Pocket</span></span></span></a><a><span><span><span>Reddit</span></span></span></a><a><span><span><span>WhatsApp</span></span></span></a><a><span><span><span>Flipboard</span></span></span></a>\\n</div></div>\\n</div> </main> <div> <div><ul>\\n<li> <div>\\n<div><a>Phone Cases</a></div> <h2><a>16 Reasons to Switch from Plastic to Wooden Phone Cases</a></h2> <div><time>29/05/2024</time></div>\\n</div> </li>\\n<li> <div>\\n<div><a>Applications</a></div> <h2><a>The Best Apps For Running (Updated!)</a></h2> <div><time>29/05/2024</time></div>\\n</div> </li>\\n<li> <div>\\n<div><a>iPhone Cases</a></div> <h2><a>Cheap iPhone 14 Cases (That Don’t Suck): 4 Solid Options For 2024</a></h2> <div><time>28/05/2024</time></div>\\n</div> </li>\\n</ul></div> </div> <footer> <div> <div> <div> <p><mark>Connect With Us!</mark></p> <p>If you want to reach out and connect with KnowYourMobile team, you’ll find us hangin’ out on the following social networks.</p> <ul>\\n<li><a><span>Twitter</span></a></li> <li><a><span>Instagram</span></a></li> <li><a><span>Facebook</span></a></li>\\n</ul> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p><mark>Company</mark></p> <div> <p><strong><a>About</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a>Contact</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a>T&amp;Cs</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a>Privacy Policy</a></strong></p> </div> </div> <div> <p><mark>Resources</mark></p> <div> <p><strong><a>Newsletter</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Editorial Policy</strong></p> <p><strong>Work With Us</strong></p> <p><strong><a>Sitemap</a></strong></p> </div> </div> <div> <p><mark>Things We ❤️</mark></p> <div> <p><strong><a>Data Privacy</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a>Proton Mail</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a>Brave</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a>GrapheneOS</a></strong></p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <p><strong>©</strong> <strong>2024</strong> · <strong>KnowYourMobile.

It's not as straightforward as returning an unwanted item to your <a>local Apple Store</a>, but it can be done. We've all had a situation where we accidentally tapped that purchase button with a slip of the finger. Or a child who managed to make a purchase without parental permission. Or even a case where a purchase didn't work as advertised. But all is not lost, you can request a refund from any of Apple's digital stores.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>You'll need good reason, though. This process isn't for creating your own free trials of apps, games, books, music, or streaming content.</p>\\n<h3><span>What you'll need</span></h3>\\n<p>To get an App Store refund you'll need an iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

The below steps show the process for the App Store specifically, though the process is much the same in Apple's other digital stores.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Open the <strong>App Store</strong>.</li>\\n<li>Tap on your <strong>photo</strong> in the top right to view your account.

Like on iOS, the process will boot you out to a web browser to complete the claim, but you can at least start the process in one of Apple's storefront apps. The steps below apply to the Mac App Store, though you can also start the process via the Music, TV, or Books apps.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Open the <strong>App Store</strong> app.</li>\\n<li>Click on your <strong>photo</strong>to view your account. If you don't have a photo set, this will be your initials.\\xa0</li>\\n<li>In the Music and TV apps, a faster way to get to your account is by clicking <strong>Account</strong> in the menu bar and selecting <strong>Account settings</strong> from the drop-down menu.</li>\\n<li>Click on the <strong>app</strong> you wish to claim a refund for.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>(Image credit: iMore)</span></figcaption></figure><ol>\\n<li>Scroll the app's listing and click on <strong>Report a Problem</strong>.

Or, the purchase you made was never received, or it doesn't work as expected. Refund requests are not for trying out the <a>best iPhone apps</a> or <a>best iPad apps</a> or any digital content as a free trial.</p>\\n<p>If your reason for requesting a refund isn't in the drop down menu, you'll have to select Other and plead your case. Apple does have the right to deny your claim; approval is not automatic.</p>\\n<p>If you do realize you've made a purchase in error or otherwise need to request a refund, be sure to do so immediately. The time frame for requesting a refund is limited and can vary by region.</p>\\n<p>Once you've made your refund request, you can expect it to take a business day or two for Apple to process it. If Apple needs to speak with your further about your claim, it might even take a bit longer.

In addition to Apple’s own version of <em>Tetris</em>, the engineering sample iPod also came loaded with other unreleased titles, including games called <em>Block0</em> and <em>Klondike,</em><a>as noted by <em>Engadget</em></a>. </p></div>\\n<div><p>On the back of the prototype iPod, a “DVT” (Design Validation Testing) label is etched where the storage capacity normally goes, which Apple Demo explains indicates it was from the middle stage of development. Two songs still in its storage and a helpfully named playlist suggest this device was used for battery testing.</p></div>\\n<div><p>After some tinkering and transplanting the internal hard disk into a second-generation iPod, Apple Demo got the hard disk to boot as normal, and out of the games available, they only demoed <em>Stacker</em>.</p></div>\\n<div><div>\\n<h3>Related</h3>\\n<ul><li><a>Before 'Angry Birds': the short life of click wheel iPod games</a></li></ul>\\n</div></div>\\n<div><p>They even contacted the ex-SVP of Apple’s iPod division, <a>Tony Fadell</a>, to learn why the <em>Tetris</em> clone was never released. However, Fadell’s only comment, from 2022, says, “because we added games with later software release,” leaving the internal story of <em>Stacker</em> a mystery for now. Apple did release a licensed <em>Tetris</em> game years later on the Classic iPod models, which supported new game titles <a>purchased from the iTunes Store</a>.</p></div>\\n<div><p><em>Stacker</em> uses the iPod’s click wheel to move falling blocks left and right, and the center button drops them to the bottom of the screen. The objective, like <em>Tetris</em>, is to shoot for a high score by completing and clearing lines of bricks and not overstacking pieces off the top. The game isn’t entirely polished — there’s at least one bug shown in the video where a brick overlapped a stack and got stuck when rotated.

Businesses can accept payments from credit and debit cards on iPhones securely\\xa0and supported partner-enabled iOS apps.</p>\\n<p>Starting today, Tap to Pay on iPhone is now being supported across Canada. Millions of businesses can begin using iPhones to accept in-person, contactless payments. Tap to Pay on iPhone streamlines the process of accepting a payment via debit or a credit card of any size. Apple Pay and other supported digital wallets can also be used while paying with an iPhone and supported iOS app. Businesses can accept payments with no additional payment terminal or hardware to worry about.</p>\\n<p>At launch, Tap to Pay on iPhone will support Adyen, Moneris, Stripe, and <a>Square in Canada</a>. As this is the first wave, more partners are expected to come on board in the near future. Apple states that “in the coming months,” Aurus; Chase Payment Solutions, a part of J.P. Morgan Payments; Fiserv; and Helcim will enable Tap to Pay on iPhone.\\xa0Tap to Pay on iPhone will also be available at retailers such as Sephora, Apple confirms.</p>\\n<p><em>“Canadians increasingly rely on a variety of digital and contactless payment options, so we’re excited to partner with payment platforms to offer merchants across Canada a private, secure, and easy-to-use capability that meets customers where they are,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. “We’ve seen how merchants and customers around the world appreciate the versatility of Tap to Pay on iPhone, and in a region as diverse as Canada’s, we look forward to making it easy for businesses of any size to transact from coast to coast with just an iPhone.”</em></p>\\n<p>Tap to Pay on iPhone first launched in the U.S. in 2022. It supports contactless credit and debit cards across payment networks such as American Express, Interac, Mastercard, and Visa. To use the feature, retailers must use a supported iOS app on an iPhone Xs or later. The device must also be running the latest version of iOS.</p>\\n<p>To accept a payment, retailers can prompt the customer to hold their contactless credit or debit card, iPhone, Apple Watch, or other digital wallet near the retailer’s iPhone. The payment will then be processed securely using NFC technology.</p>\\n<p>Apple also notes that payment data is processed the same way as Apple Pay. All transactions are encrypted and processed using ‘Secure Element.’ At no point during the payment process does Apple know what is being purchased and by who, the company states.</p>\\n<p>For more information, retailers can check out <a>Apple’s small business website</a>.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div><i><b>P.S.

Jobs said that the iPhone was three products: a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communications device. An iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator. All in a single device. Do you get it?</p>\\n<p>At the time, the iPhone only had a 3.5-inch display, a 2-megapixel camera, and maxed-out storage of 16GB with only 128MB of RAM. You couldn’t copy and paste text, there was no MMS support, and you only had web apps, not native third-party apps. Plus, the iPhone was exclusive to AT&amp;T (formerly Cingular) at this time, so if you wanted an iPhone, it had to be with only that carrier.</p>\\n<p>The original iPhone is lacking by today’s standards, but back then, it was revolutionary. Most other cell phones still had physical keyboards and keypads. Touchscreens were nowhere near as popular back in the day. Some tech CEOs, such as Steve Balmer, mocked Apple for creating the iPhone and didn’t think it would succeed. Well, the joke’s on them.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 3G (July 2008)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Apple</span></figcaption></figure><p>In July 2008, Apple followed up the original iPhone with the iPhone 3G. Similar to its predecessor, it had a 3.5-inch display, 2MP camera, 128MB of RAM, and up to 16GB of storage.</p>\\n<p>But as the name suggests, this version of the iPhone added 3G connectivity (the original iPhone only supported Edge speeds) and introduced the App Store, where users could download native apps from third-party developers.</p>\\n<p>Though these were pretty iterative additions by today’s standards, the launch of the App Store was actually huge. This began the whole “there’s an app for that” era and changed how all of us use our iPhones.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 3GS (June 2009)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Apple</span></figcaption></figure><p>When Apple introduced the App Store in 2008, it changed how people use their iPhones. The old maximum storage of 16GB just wasn’t going to cut it anymore, so Apple increased the specs on the iPhone 3GS, which came out in June 2009.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 3GS increased the storage to 32GB, and the RAM went up to 256MB. This doubled the storage and RAM of the original iPhone and even the iPhone 3G to make room for all of the cool apps you could now download from the App Store.</p>\\n<p>Not only did the iPhone 3GS get more internal storage and RAM, but it even improved the camera. Apple upgraded the camera to a 3MP autofocus camera, which resulted in better-looking photos than its predecessors. There was also a new built-in digital compass and even the introduction of new accessibility features like VoiceOver.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 4 (June 2010)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Apple</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 4 was a monumental step for the future of the iPhone. Though it retained the same 3.5-inch display as before, Apple upgraded the screen to a Retina display, which had a whopping 326 pixels per inch (ppi) density. At this high resolution, the human eye is unable to distinguish individual pixels on the screen. It was a drastic upgrade from the previous iterations of the iPhone and set the stage for Apple to add Retina displays to all of its other products eventually.</p>\\n<p>But that wasn’t the only major feature of the iPhone 4. Apple also added a front-facing camera for the first time, making it possible to have video calls on a mobile device. It also made selfies a thing. The rear camera got an improved 5MP lens with LED flash and became a gold standard for mobile photography.</p>\\n<p>This was also the first big hardware design change for the iPhone. While the first three versions were fairly rounded and made with plastic, the iPhone 4 moved to a new glass and stainless steel design with flat edges that we still see today.</p>\\n<p>However, the antenna design with the metal frame seemed to affect the signal when held in the left hand, leading to the first major iPhone scandal, dubbed “antennagate.” Jobs claimed users were “holding it wrong,” but eventually relented and offered free bumper cases for everyone to rectify the issue.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 4 was also the first iPhone that became available on Verizon with its CDMA network, as it was no longer an AT&amp;T exclusive.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 4S (October 2011)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Apple</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Apple had been releasing new iPhones in the summer season, things changed with the introduction of the iPhone 4S. This was the first iPhone that Apple announced and began selling in the fall, which is a trend that Apple continues to this day. Though the iPhone 4S launched in October 2011, Apple then moved to September launches for later iPhones, with a few exceptions.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 4S took things a step further for mobile iPhone photographers by adding an 8MP camera that would set the standard for several more years. It also added 1080p video recording, which was a big milestone. And since the higher megapixel count and 1080p videos would mean bigger file sizes, Apple also bumped the maximum storage to 64GB.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 4S was significant because this was the first iPhone with Apple’s digital assistant, Siri (that’s what the “S” stands for in “4S”). Users could ask Siri to perform various tasks just by using their voice.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 4S also coincided with Apple’s launch of iCloud, which is Apple’s in-house cloud storage solution. It gives everyone 5GB of storage for free, which ironically, has not changed in over a decade, despite larger file sizes from photos and video, as well as cloud backups.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 4S also launched on Sprint, further expanding the network choices for buyers.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 5 (September 2012)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Andy Boxall / Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like the iPhone 4 before it, the iPhone 5 also introduced some major changes. With the iPhone 5, we got a larger, 4-inch screen, LTE connectivity, and an HD front-facing FaceTime camera.</p>\\n<p>This was also when Apple switched from the old 30-pin charging port to the Lightning connector, which became standard for iPhones for the next 10 years.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 5 also introduced a new aluminum design that was incredibly lightweight and comfortable to hold. This design would end up being a favorite for many fans, including myself. However, the space gray version was prone to micro scratches due to the anodized finish on the aluminum.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 5S and 5C (September 2013)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the iPhone 5S and 5C, Apple introduced two different iPhone models at once for the first time. The iPhone 5S would be the flagship and main star of the show, while the iPhone 5C was marketed as a more budget-friendly option that made some compromises to features.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 5S was the first iPhone with Touch ID in the Home button, which added another layer of biometric security before one could access their device. It also improved the 8MP camera and included True Tone flash, along with new camera modes for burst photos and slo-mo.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 5C was marketed as a more affordable, budget-friendly option, so it did make some compromises. Rather than have the aluminum body like its sibling, the body for the iPhone 5C was entirely made of plastic (it was “beautifully, unapologetically plastic,” as Apple designer Jony Ive put it), and it came in bright and bold colors for the first time ever.</p>\\n<p>Apple also released a case specifically for the iPhone 5C that featured hole cutouts that allowed the iPhone 5C color to peek through the case.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 5C did not include the Touch ID sensor in the Home button. It only had the passcode method to unlock the phone.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (September 2014)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is when Apple began to introduce two different screen sizes for the iPhone. The iPhone 6 had a 4.7-inch display, while the iPhone 6 Plus had a larger 5.5-inch display. The overall design was thinner, with a unibody aluminum body.</p>\\n<p>However, the thinner body sparked another scandal called “bendgate.” This was because some people discovered that their iPhone 6 chassis would bend if enough pressure was applied, such as when it was kept in a tight back pocket of a pair of pants.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were also the first iPhones to add Apple Pay, a new contactless digital payment method that can be authenticated with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Storage was also increased to a max of 128GB.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 6s and 6s Plus (September 2015)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Jessica Lee Star / Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>About a year later, Apple launched the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. These two phones retained the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays from its predecessor, as well as the overall look and design. But this would be the first time that it launched the Rose Gold color, which was a gorgeous metallic pink. It was a fan favorite for many people, myself included.</p>\\n<p>Apple also introduced 3D Touch with the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. With 3D Touch, users could apply pressure on the iPhone display to bring up additional options, such as contextual menus on app icons on the home screen. It seems that 3D Touch was more of a hidden feature, however, as not everyone knew about it, and Apple eventually discontinued the feature years later with the iPhone 11.</p>\\n<p>Apple upgraded the cameras to 12MP for the first time, a bump up from the previous 8MP camera. The 12MP lens would be the standard until the iPhone 14 Pro launched in 2023.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 6s series is also when Live Photos was introduced, which is a combination of a still image and a short video. When a person takes a Live Photo, it captures a couple of seconds before and after the moment the shutter button is pressed. A Live Photo looks like a still image, but when you activate it with a long press, it plays a few seconds of sound and motion.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are also the first iPhones that allowed users to activate Siri at any time with the “Hey Siri” command instead of just when it was plugged into power.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone SE (March 2016)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first iPhone SE was an interesting product, and showed that Apple can make a budget-friendly option that doesn’t feel cheap, unlike the iPhone 5C. With the iPhone SE, it combined most of the features and capabilities of the current iPhone 6s lineup into the body of an iPhone 5.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone SE also defined the idea of the perfect compact iPhone for many people. The 4-inch display made it possible to use one-handed, and you got a 12MP camera, 4K video recording, Live Photos, and “Hey Siri” without needing to be plugged in. It was a great form factor that didn’t compromise on features aside from 3D Touch.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (September 2016)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus marked a big turning point for the iPhone. The launch of the iPhone 7 line meant the death of the headphone jack, but also saw the first generation of AirPods debut alongside it.</p>\\n<p>But that wasn’t all. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus introduced a sleeker design than the iPhone 6s, getting rid of those unsightly antenna strips on the rear. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus also became the first iPhones with an IP67 water-resistance rating for better durability. Apple also introduced the beautiful and shiny Jet Black color option, which would never be seen again after the iPhone 7.</p>\\n<p>However, the star of the lineup was the iPhone 7 Plus, as it was the first iPhone to have a dual camera setup with a main camera and a telephoto lens. And thanks to the dual lens, Apple introduced Portrait mode. To keep up with the camera improvements, maximum storage was also increased to 256GB.</p>\\n<p>Again, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were a turning point for mobile photography by adding Portrait mode. This lets people take professional-looking portraits that replicate what you get when using a DSLR camera, but now you could do it with your iPhone. After this, Portrait mode became incredibly popular and standard on every smartphone.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 8 and 8 Plus (September 2017)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Julian Chokkattu / Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were interesting devices, as they signaled the end of the Home button era for mainline iPhones. Apple brought a new glass and aluminum design, though the form factor was similar to its predecessor. This new body allowed for wireless charging for the very first time on an iPhone.</p>\\n<p>One of the bigger features that the iPhone 8 added was Portrait Lighting. This lets users change the lighting style for Portrait mode images, making them look even more professional. The iPhone 8 was also the first iPhone to support augmented reality (AR) in apps and games, which brought a whole new experience to mobile.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus also launched around the same time as the iPhone X, which ushered in a new era for the iPhone. However, the iPhone 8 body has been recycled for future iPhone SE models.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone X (November 2017)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Julian Chokkattu / Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>To signify a decade of iPhone, the <a>iPhone X</a> was a special edition to celebrate the occasion.</p>\\n<p>It also introduced the next era of the iPhone by removing the Home button and Touch ID sensor in favor of a new biometric form of security called Face ID. Rather than use your fingerprint to unlock your phone, all it needs to do is scan your face.</p>\\n<p>Since Apple removed the Home button, that meant the iPhone X was the first iPhone to have a 5.8-inch full-screen design, and it introduced the notch that people either loved or hated for years to come. This is also the first iPhone with an OLED Super Retina display.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone X was definitely a milestone in the history of the iPhone. For a decade, we’d been used to an iPhone with a Home button, but the iPhone X completely changed that and established a new iconic look. And we barely have Touch ID anymore except on a few select devices these days.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone XS and XS Max (September 2018)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Julian Chokkattu / Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the iPhone XS and XS Max, Apple finally eliminated the Home button from the flagship devices. Apple also brought back a larger form factor with the Max moniker, and introduced a 6.5-inch display, making the iPhone XS Max the largest iPhone yet at the time. The regular iPhone XS still retained the 5.8-inch display from its predecessor.</p>\\n<p>Other improvements with the iPhone XS and XS Max were faster Face ID, better water resistance with an IP68 rating, and dual SIM support for the first time, as it added support for eSIM alongside the physical nano SIM card slot. The iPhone XS and XS Max also could handle Gigabit LTE for even faster download speeds. And the maximum storage tier went up to 512GB.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone XS and XS Max are significant as they set the new precedent for two sizes of full-screen iPhones going forward. The XS Max is also the first “Max” iPhone.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone XR (October 2018)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone XR was a one-off that launched with the iPhone XS and XS Max. It was designed to be a cheaper version of the XS and XS Max.</p>\\n<p>Despite the iPhone XR having a larger screen than the iPhone XS at 6.1 inches, it was only a Liquid Retina LCD display rather than OLED like the flagship models. It also only had a single rear camera, as well as a slightly lower IP67 water-resistance rating compared to the IP68 on the XS and XS Max. The iPhone XR also came in six vibrant colors, and the cheaper price point appealed to people who were on a tighter budget.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone XR didn’t do anything groundbreaking, but it was the first iPhone that had the 6.1-inch display size that has become the norm for the iPhone in the past few years. And while it wasn’t a major flagship phone, the budget-friendly price point helped boost it to be one of the most popular smartphones in 2019.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 11 series (September 2019)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Julian Chokkattu / Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 11 series included the <a>iPhone 11</a>, <a>iPhone 11 Pro</a>, and <a>iPhone 11 Pro Max</a>. This is the first time that Apple has introduced three iPhone models together at the same time ( the iPhone 8/X and iPhone XS/XR were a month apart), and it set the new standard of\\xa0 a standard iPhone, a Pro model, and a larger Pro Max.</p>\\n<p>This is also the first time that Apple included an ultrawide lens on all models, as well as the new U1 chip with ultra-wideband technology.</p>\\n<p>Furthermore, the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max were the first to have triple camera setups with a main, ultrawide, and telephoto lens. Apple also upgraded the displays to Super Retina XDR OLED displays and improved battery life.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 11 Pro models set the stage for the next several years of iPhones to come. Though the cameras have continued to get larger over the years, even current iPhones still have that same triple-lens camera layout that debuted with the iPhone 11 Pro.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone SE 2 (April 2020)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple surprised everyone in the middle of an iPhone life cycle by bringing back the iPhone SE, four years after the original, in the form of the iPhone SE 2. While it wasn’t as small and compact as the original, it still appealed to those who prefer small phones, and the hardware wasn’t too shabby either.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone SE 2 recycled the old chassis of the iPhone 8 while still using the A13 chip that was inside the iPhone 11 series. With the 4.7-inch screen, the iPhone SE 2 brought back the Home button and Touch ID for those who preferred it.</p>\\n<p>In 2020, the iPhone SE 2 provided an excellent value. It was the most affordable iPhone one could buy, and despite looking like the old iPhone 8, the iPhone SE 2 had more capabilities like Portrait mode with a single lens camera.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 12 series (October 2020)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Andrew Martonik / Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 12 series was the first time Apple introduced four iPhones at the same time with three different sizes: the <a>iPhone 12 mini</a>, <a>iPhone 12</a>, <a>iPhone 12 Pro</a>, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. The iPhone 12 mini, in particular, was unique because it was the smallest and most compact iPhone that Apple offered — offering a 5.4-inch display that still had the full-screen design of the rest of the iPhone 12 lineup.</p>\\n<p>Apple equipped the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 with dual rear cameras, but once again offered a triple camera system for the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Apple also debuted Ceramic Shield, which is a coating on the front glass to make it more shatter-resistant. The Pro models also added lidar for better augmented reality experiences.</p>\\n<p>The entire iPhone 12 lineup was a big deal, however. These were the first iPhones to have <a>5G</a> support, and introduced Apple’s proprietary MagSafe magnetic wireless charging and accessory ecosystem. With 2G/EDGE networks already put to pasture by most carriers and 3G soon to followit into obscurity, having 5G support was crucial, as it coexists with 4G/LTE and will be around for a long time. MagSafe also opened up a whole new world of creative accessories and is also a major influence on the <a>new Qi2 wireless charging standard</a>.</p>\\n<p>But the iPhone 12 series also removed the in-box charger. Apple began only providing the charging cable, so people would have to either use their previous charger or buy a new one. Other brands mostly followed suit.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 13 series (September 2021)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Dan Baker / Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>For the most part, the iPhone 13 line was very similar to the iPhone 12 before it. We got four models: the iPhone 13 mini, <a>iPhone 13</a>, <a>iPhone 13 Pro</a>, and iPhone 13 Pro Max. The biggest differences were the new colors and a smaller notch.</p>\\n<p>But the iPhone 13 lineup did bring some other notable changes, including the A15 Bionic chip that gave a big boost to overall battery life. Cinematic video mode also launched with the iPhone 13 line, giving videos a depth effect that changed focus automatically, depending on what was going on in the scene.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max were also the first iPhones to get the 120Hz ProMotion display, which set the standard for future Pro models to come. With the higher adaptive refresh rate, scrolling and animations are smoother than ever. Though it’s not as drastic of a change as when Apple introduced the Retina display on the iPhone 4, it is still noticeable when you compare the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro side by side.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 13 Pro was also the first iPhone to go up to 1TB in storage capacity.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone SE 3 (March 2022)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Andy Boxall / Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple delivered an iPhone SE 3 in 2022, but it was less impressive than when the second generation of the device launched. It still had the iPhone 8 body with a 4.7-inch display and the Home button with Touch ID.</p>\\n<p>However, this time around, Apple stuffed it with the A15 Bionic chip, which was the same as the iPhone 13 line. It also added 5G connectivity support, which means it should be future-proof for a good while. Battery life was also a bit better than before.</p>\\n<p>Otherwise, not much else changed. It’s unclear if there will be an iPhone SE 4, but we hope to see an updated design — the iPhone 8 body is very outdated these days.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 14 Series (September 2022)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Joe Maring / Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>Though the iPhone 14 series continued the tradition of four iPhone models, Apple eliminated the mini from the lineup and replaced it with the new Plus offering, which is the same size as the Pro Max. The reasoning for getting rid of the mini was due to poor sales performance, and Apple believed more people would be interested in a Plus model over a mini.</p>\\n<p>For the most part, the standard <a>iPhone 14</a>\\xa0and <a>iPhone 14 Plus</a> brought over features from the iPhone 13, including the A15 Bionic. But the biggest upgrades came in the <a>iPhone 14 Pro</a> and <a>iPhone 14 Pro Max</a> with the Dynamic Island, which replaced the notch that debuted with the iPhone X, and a bump to the cameras to 48MP from 12MP. This was also the first iPhone with an always-on display.</p>\\n<p>The entire iPhone 14 line also got the new Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite features aimed at saving lives. The iPhone 14 series is also the first iPhone in the U.S. to eliminate physical SIM card trays and switch exclusively to eSIM.</p>\\n<p>While the standard iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus were iterative upgrades, the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max would play a major part in influencing the future direction of the iPhone. The Dynamic Island would eventually make its way to all iPhone models, getting rid of the ugly notch, and the 48MP would become the new baseline.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 15 Series (September 2023)</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>Apple iPhone 15 Plus (left) and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</span> <span>Andy Boxall / Digital Trends</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 15 line has brought some of the biggest changes in the history of the iPhone yet. The base model <a>iPhone 15</a> and <a>iPhone 15 Plus</a> both get a big camera boost to 48MP, like the iPhone 14 Pro did last year, and they dumped the notch for the Dynamic Island.</p>\\n<p>The <a>iPhone 15 Pro</a> and <a>iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> got even bigger upgrades with the new titanium frame instead of stainless steel, the A17 Pro chip, and the new 5x telephoto lens on the Pro Max. Apple also got rid of the classic silent/ring toggle and replaced it with a new Action button, similar to that found on the Apple Watch Ultra, which users can map to different functions as they see fit.</p>\\n<p>But the biggest change, and the one that the entire iPhone 15 lineup will probably be remembered for, is the fact that it replaced the proprietary Lightning charging port with USB-C. Lightning had been around since the iPhone 5 in 2012, so the cable that everyone had been using for the past decade was finally dead.</p>\\n<p>Apple dropping its own proprietary charger, which it made a lot of money from licensing out, for a more universal option is a very big deal. Plus, it opened up a whole new world of USB-C accessories that were previously incompatible.</p>\\n<p>And there’s no doubt that the switch to titanium will have an impact on future iPhones and even the competition. Other brands have already begun to copy the titanium design, such as the <a>OnePlus Open</a> and even the <a>Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p>\\n<h4>Editors' Recommendations</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a>6 things we expect from WWDC 2024: iOS 18, AI, and more</a></li>\\n<li><a>Don’t expect a folding iPhone anytime soon</a></li>\\n<li><a>The iPhone’s new AI features may come with a gigantic catch</a></li>\\n<li><a>iOS 18 may give Siri the upgrade we’ve been waiting for</a></li>\\n<li><a>5 tablets you should buy instead of the iPad Air (2024)</a></li>\\n</ul></article><div>\\n<div>Topics</div>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a>Apple</a></li>\\n<li><a>Apple iPhone</a></li>\\n<li><a>Features</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n<div><section><div>\\n<div><a>Christine Romero-Chan</a></div>\\n<div>Staff Writer, Mobile</div>\\n<div>\\n<a>facebook</a><a>instagram</a><a>linkedin</a><a>Email</a> </div>\\n</div>\\n<div>Christine Romero-Chan has been writing about technology, specifically Apple, for over a decade.

For example, one of the main features that makes Kino stand out is Instant Grade, which uses the Log video recording mode, which was introduced on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p> </div>\\n<a>Read more</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div>\\n<div><div><ul><li><a><span>Mobile</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\\n<div>Apple offers peek at how it stress tests the iPhone</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<p>Apple tests the water resistance of an iPhone.

But how exactly Google ranks websites has long been a mystery, pieced together by journalists, researchers, and people working in search engine optimization.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Now, an explosive leak that purports to show <a>thousands of pages of internal documents</a> appears to offer an unprecedented look under the hood of how Search works — and suggests that Google hasn’t been entirely truthful about it for years. So far, Google hasn’t responded to multiple requests for comment on the legitimacy of the documents.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Rand Fishkin, who worked in SEO for more than a decade, says a source shared 2,500 pages of documents with him with the hopes that reporting on the leak would counter the “lies” that Google employees had shared about how the search algorithm works. The documents outline Google’s search API and break down what information is available to employees, according to Fishkin.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The details shared by Fishkin are dense and technical, likely more legible to developers and SEO experts than the layperson. The contents of the leak are also not necessarily proof that Google uses the specific data and signals it mentions for search rankings. Rather, the leak outlines what data Google collects from webpages, sites, and searchers and offers indirect hints to SEO experts about what Google seems to care about, as SEO expert Mike King <a>wrote</a> in his overview of the documents.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The leaked documents touch on topics like what kind of data Google collects and uses, which sites Google elevates for sensitive topics like elections, how Google handles small websites, and more. Some information in the documents appears to be in conflict with public statements by Google representatives, according to Fishkin and King.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“‘Lied’ is harsh, but it’s the only accurate word to use here,” King writes. “While I don’t necessarily fault Google’s public representatives for protecting their proprietary information, I do take issue with their efforts to actively discredit people in the marketing, tech, and journalism worlds who have presented reproducible discoveries.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Google has not responded to <em>The Verge’</em>s requests for commentregarding the documents, including a direct request to refute their legitimacy. Fishkin told <em>The Verge</em>in an email that the company has not disputed the veracity of the leak, but that an employee asked him to change some language in the post regarding how an event was characterized.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Google’s secretive search algorithm has <a>birthed an entire industry</a> of marketers who closely follow Google’s public guidance and execute it for millions of companies around the world. The pervasive, often annoying tactics have led to a general narrative that Google Search results are getting worse, crowded with junk that website operators <a>feel required to produce</a> to have their sites seen. In response to <em>The Verge</em>’s past reporting on the SEO-driven tactics, Google representatives often fall back to a familiar defense: that’s not what the <a>Google guidelines</a> say. </p></div>\\n<div><p>But some details in the leaked documents call into question the accuracy of Google’s public statements regarding how Search works.</p></div>\\n<div><p>One example cited by Fishkin and King is whether Google Chrome data is used in ranking at all. Google representatives have <a>repeatedly</a> <a>indicated</a> that it doesn’t use Chrome data to rank pages, but Chrome is <a>specifically mentioned in sections</a> about how websites appear in Search. In the screenshot below, which I captured as an example, the links appearing below the main vogue.com URL may be created in part using Chrome data, according to the documents.</p></div>\\n<div><div><div>\\n<figcaption><em>Chrome is mentioned in a section about how additional links are created.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Google</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>Another question raised is what role, if any, E-E-A-T plays in ranking. E-E-A-T stands for experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness, <a>a Google metric used to evaluate the quality of results</a>. Google representatives have <a>previously said E-E-A-T isn’t a ranking factor</a>. Fishkin notes that he hasn’t found much in the documents mentioning E-E-A-T by name.</p></div>\\n<div><p>King, however, detailed how Google appears to collect author data from a page and has a field for whether an entity on the page is the author. A portion of the documents shared by King reads that the field was “mainly developed and tuned for news articles... but is also populated for other content (e.g., scientific articles).” Though this doesn’t confirm that bylines are an explicit ranking metric, it does show that Google is at least keeping track of this attribute. Google representatives have <a>previously insisted</a> that author bylines are something website owners should do for readers, not Google, because it doesn’t impact rankings.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Though the documents aren’t exactly a smoking gun, they provide a deep, unfiltered look at a tightly guarded black box system. The <a>US government’s antitrust case against Google</a> — which revolves around Search — has also led to internal documentation becoming public, offering further insights into how the company’s main product works. </p></div>\\n<div><p>Google’s general caginess on how Search works has led to <a>websites looking the same</a> as SEO marketers try to outsmart Google based on hints the company offers. Fishkin also calls out the publications credulously propping up Google’s public claims as truth without much further analysis.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“Historically, some of the search industry’s loudest voices and most prolific publishers have been happy to uncritically repeat Google’s public statements.

It’s true to call it the touchscreen smartphone that started it all. Before the iPhone everything looked different; after the iPhone everything else looked like an iPhone.</span></p>\\n<p><span>With the</span><span>iPhone 5S about to go on sale</span><span>we take a look at how the iPhone developed over the years.</span></p>\\n<p><span>In 2007 Steve Jobs took to the stage to announce the iPhone: “Today, we’re introducing three revolutionary products,” he said. “The first one is a widescreen iPod with touch controls. The second is a revolutionary mobile phone. The third is a breakthrough internet communications device.</span></p>\\n<p><span>“These are not three separate devices. This is one device. And we are calling it iPhone. Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone.”</span></p>\\n<p><span>See:</span><a><span>iPhone UK (first-generation review)</span></a><span>.</span></p>\\n<p><em>The iPhone 1 (First Generation)</em></p>\\n<h2><span>Watch Steve Jobs launch the original iPhone</span></h2>\\n<p><span>While you’re waiting for the iPhone 5S to launch, or your iPhone 5C to arrive, you might want to remember how the original iPhone looked all those years ago.</span></p>\\n<p>;</p>\\n<p><span>This historic launch was considered one of Steve Jobs’ finest hours. A forty minute presentation in which he outlined exactly how the smartphone of the future should look. He turned out to be right: here we are six years later and every successful smartphone since then has either been an iPhone, or looked like an iPhone. All the other phones like BlackBerry, Windows and feature phones with old-fashioned keys have gradually become phased out.</span></p>\\n<p><span>Let’s take a look at how the iPhone slowly evolved into the smartphone we we know today.</span></p>\\n<h2><span>A history of the IPhone</span></h2>\\n<p><span>Apple has launched eight iPhone models in six years (if we include the two models launched this year).</span></p>\\n<p><span>The first iPhone was a far cry from the fingerprint reading, Retina Display-powered and Siri-sporting model that is about to go on sale. The first iPhone had quite a number of high profile features missing. It didn’t have 3G, for a start, the fastest form of mobile internet at the time (let alone 4G). It also lacked GPS, the ability to install apps or a front-facing camera. The rear-facing camera wasn’t much to shout about either, being just 2-megapixels.</span></p>\\n<p><span>Above all it was fiercely expensive. Costing £269 for an 8GB model with a 18-month contract from O2 (at £35 per month). The total cost was £899. And you got just 200 minutes and 200 texts per month for that price, although you also got unlimited internet.</span></p>\\n<p><span>See:</span><a><span>iPhone 5C pricing and tariffs</span></a></p>\\n<p><span>So just why was the iPhone so successful? It’s easy to look back and see what was missing, but unless you were there it’s also hard to understand just how revolutionary the iPhone was. Prior to 2007 mobile phones mostly had physical keyboards, if they had touch screens they came with styluses and were inaccurate and fiddly to use: screens were small; mobile internet was laughably expensive, and with the small screen and slow processors available it was largely useless. The same could be said of maps, video, music and most other basic features. Perhaps the only part of the Internet that had made it to the mobile phone was e-mail, and BlackBerry had made a successful living selling large format mobile phones with QWERTY keyboards and integrated internet.</span></p>\\n<p><em>The iPhone 3G &amp; 3GS</em></p>\\n<p><span>The iPhone changed all that overnight. Apple’s genius was to fuse a battery and touch-screen together. In essence making the device one huge battery and screen. This made a large multi-touch screen possible. You couldn’t also fit a keyboard so Apple created a multi-touch on-screen keyboard with the best typing correction it could. And you couldn’t remove the battery so whatever battery life you got you stuck with. This was around six to eight hours, but that compared pretty badly with the 36+ hours that many feature phones offered.</span></p>\\n<p><span>There were doubts: that battery was (and remains) a problem for many people; the camera wasn’t powerful enough and the lack of 3G a clear problem. All of this was because Apple had to squeeze every last drop out of the battery to power the massive – for those days – 3.5inch display.</span></p>\\n<p><span>Apple’s gamble was that people would prefer to use a device that enabled them to watch video, play music, browse the Internet comfortably, and use services like YouTube and Google Maps more than they’d like a keyboard or removable battery. The gamble paid off. Apple sold six million iPhones and has sold more ever since, selling approximately 400 million iPhones to date, and is said to be close to having shipped 700 million iOS devices in total.</span></p>\\n<p><em>The iPhone 4 &amp; 4S</em></p>\\n<h2><span>Comparing the iPhone history</span></h2>\\n<p><span>Here is a comparison chart of the iPhone models, and how they’ve shaped up.</span></p>\\n<div><table><tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><p><span>iPhone</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>iPhone 3G</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>iPhone 3GS</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>iPhone 4</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>iPhone 4S</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>iPhone 5</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>iPhone 5C</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>iPhone 5S</span></p></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><p><span>Capacity (GB)</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>4, 8, 16 GB</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>8 &amp; 16 GB</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>8, 16, 32 GB</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>8, 16, 32 GB</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>16, 32, 64 GB</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>16, 32, 64 GB</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>16 &amp; 32 GB</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>16, 32, 64 GB</span></p></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><p><span>Colours</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Black</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Black</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Black</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Black &amp; White</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Black &amp; White</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Black &amp; White/Silver</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>White, Pink, Yellow, Blue, Green</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Gold, Silver, Space Gray</span></p></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><p><span>Processor</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>620Mhz ARM</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>620Mhz ARM</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>833Mhz ARM</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>1 GHZ A4</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>1 GHZ A5</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>1.3 GHZ A6</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>1.3 GHZ A6</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>1.7GHz A7</span></p></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><p><span>Connection</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Edge &amp; Wi-Fi B/G</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3G (3.6Mb) &amp; Wi-Fi B/G</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3G (3.6Mb) &amp; Wi-Fi B/G</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3G (7.2Mb) &amp; Wi-Fi B/G/N</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3G (7.2) &amp; Wi-Fi B/G/N</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3G (7.2Mb), 4G (14.4Mb) &amp; Wi-Fi A/B/G/N</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3G (7.2Mb), 4G/LTE (14.4Mb) &amp; Wi-Fi A/B/G/N</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3G (7.2Mb), 4G/LTE (14.4Mb) &amp; Wi-Fi A/B/G/N</span></p></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><p><span>Display</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3.5in HVGA</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3.5in HVGA</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3.5in HVGA</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3.5in Retina</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3.5in Retina</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>4in Retina</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>4in Retina</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>4in Retina</span></p></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><p><span>Camera</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>2-MP</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>2-MP</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3-MP</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>5-MP iSight &amp; LED Flash / 0.3-MP Facetime</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>8-MP iSight &amp; LED Flash / 0.3-MP Facetime</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>8-MP iSight &amp; LED Flash / 0.3-MP Facetime</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>8-MP iSight &amp; LED Flash / 0.3-MP Facetime</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>8-MP iSight &amp; Dual LED Flash / 0.3-MP Facetime</span></p></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><p><span>Special Feature</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Introduction</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>3G Cellullar</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Faster CPU</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Retina Display</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Siri</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Larger 4-in screen</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Colours</span></p></td>\\n<td><p><span>Fingerscan unlock</span></p></td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody></table></div>\\n<p><a>Wikipedia has more detailed information</a> on the various iPhone models.</p>\\n<p><em>The iPhone 5C</em></p>\\n<h2><span>What kind of reception did each iPhone get?</span></h2>\\n<p><span>The launch of iPhones has been beset with praise, criticism and equal amounts of fanboy love and hate. Here – in a nutshell – is what was said about each phone.</span></p>\\n<p><span><strong>iPhone:</strong> </span>The JesusPhone (ssshhhh… let’s pretend we all never called it that.)</p>\\n<p><span><strong>iPhone 3G:</strong> The one where mobile Internet finally didn’t suck.</span></p>\\n<p><span><strong>iPhone 3S:</strong> The one fast enough to play games.</span></p>\\n<p><span><strong>iPhone 4:</strong> Apple fans: “OMG have you seen the Retina Display”; Android fans: “You’re holding it wrong lol”</span></p>\\n<p><span><strong>iPhone 4S:</strong> Hello… Siri… *ba-ding* “Yes…” “Er… Er… What do I say to this thing…” *ba-dong*?</span></p>\\n<p><span><strong>iPhone 5:</strong> Bigger is better, right? Even if 4in is still a little small next to the Samsungs.</span></p>\\n<p><span><strong>iPhone 5C:</strong> The one Jony Ive probably wanted in the first place</span></p>\\n<p><span><strong>iPhone 5S:</strong> The blingin’ gold one with finger scanning anti-theft protection (we hope it deters the thieves).</span></p>\\n<h2><span>Which iPhone was the best?</span></h2>\\n<p><span>Which iPhone was the best to own is always a potted question. The first iPhone was by far the best in the respects that very few other people owned one, giving ownership a certain kudos value. And it was very different at the time, as Digg’s Kevin Rose once said: “It’s like holding something from the future”.</span></p>\\n<p><span>The iPhone 3G was both cheaper and more functional though, but its processor struggled with iOS 2.0 and a lot of apps ran slowly on it. The iPhone 3GS was the point where everything seemed to come together. It wasn’t the most exciting new phone (the key feature seemed to be a 3D compass), but it was the one where everything just worked. Ever since it’s got slowly better and the latest model, or the latest one you can afford, is always the best.</span></p>\\n<p><em>The iPhone 5S.

He described it as three devices in one: a “widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communications device.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>But since its first unveiling, the iPhone has become much more than that. It’s a symbol of the tech industry, of the modern era as a whole, and has made Apple the largest company in the world in terms of <a>market capitalization</a>. In 2015, it was speculated to be the <a>most profitable</a> product ever and helped grow Apple’s market cap to not just <a>$1 trillion</a> or <a>$2 trillion</a> — but <a>as high as $3 trillion</a>.</p></div>\\n<div><p>One reason for that is the steady pace of progress Apple has made to keep the iPhone at the top of the fray. It started with a compact device that focused on user interface and software, then upgraded network speeds and processor specs. Later, it added incrementally better cameras, followed the market to add bigger screens, and kept introducing new software and security features.</p></div>\\n<div><p>A decade and a half on, the iPhone is still making headlines. Let’s take a walk down iPhone memory lane to see where it is now and where it has been:</p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max</a> (2022)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Image: Apple</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone notch has broke off the edge and now floats as an island... a Dynamic Island. That’s what Apple calls its new morphing notch on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, its first significant change of appearance since the iPhone X in 2017. The new screen cutout accommodates the TrueDepth camera and Face ID hardware, and it digitally morphs into larger sizes to provide creative status indicators and notifications using a bit of software magic. The biggest upgrade in the Pros is the new 48MP sensor that can be taken full advantage of with ProRes RAW photo support.

With the iPhone 14, Apple is bringing a Max-sized screen to the non-pro line, making the size more affordable for those that don’t care for cutting-edge features (and prices). Both the 14 and 14 Plus introduce a higher resolution TrueDepth camera sensor, an upgraded main shooter, car crash detection, and emergency satellite communication. It’s also the first iPhone to completely drop the SIM card slot in favor of eSIM in the US.</p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone SE</a> (2022)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The third-generation iPhone SE is almost a carbon copy of the 2020 model, but it received the latest processor and got a new 5G cellular radio. Those upgrades couldn’t keep the original price point, though, as the phone’s cost of entry raised to $429 — still for just 64GB of storage. <em>Verge</em> Score: <a>8 out of 10</a></p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max</a> (2021)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>At first glance, the iPhone 13 Pro looks just like the 12 Pro, but next to each other, you can see the camera lenses have grown —\\xa0hinting at the array of camera updates in these models. The 13 Pro came with 3x optical zoom, support for macro photography, and better low-light performance on the wide and ultrawide cameras. Video was better than ever, with an option for shooting ProRes footage, and a new Cinematic Mode created an impression of depth-of-field between subjects while shooting. With the iPhone 13 Pro series, Apple finally added ProMotion high refresh rate screens that had become a standard on most flagship Android devices. <em>Verge</em> Score: <a>9 out of 10</a></p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 13 and 13 mini</a> (2021)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>iPhone 13 could easily have been an “S” year phone, resembling the 12 in most ways. The cameras got upgraded with similar sensors to those in the previous year’s iPhone 12 Pro (but still had only two cameras), and the lenses got rearranged in a diagonal alignment instead of a vertical one. Apple did give both of the 13 models a noticeable boosts in battery life compared to the 12, and Apple finally stopped shipping its flagships with 64GB of storage by making 128GB the new entry size. <em>Verge</em> Score: <a>9 out of 10</a></p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max</a> (2020)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>iPhone 12 Pro offered some extra features with snazzier trimmings compared to the similarly designed iPhone 12. You get a stainless steel frame, a matte glass finish on the back, and a telephoto camera, on top of the upgrade to 5G. In true for-the-pros fashion, the iPhone 12 Pro has a lidar scanner for 3D mapping applications and for assisting with portrait mode. The phone can also shoot photos in ProRes RAW format. And Apple made its largest screened iPhone yet with the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s huge 6.7-inch screen. <em>Verge</em> Score: <a>9 out of 10</a></p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 12 and 12 mini</a> (2020)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>iPhone 12 brought back the flat-edged, glass sandwich design that Apple first used on the iPhone 4 in 2010. The 12 had a wide and ultrawide camera like the iPhone 11, but it traded in the LCD for an OLED screen. And small phone enthusiasts rejoiced as Apple revealed a shrunken version: the iPhone 12 mini. iPhone 12 introduced 5G cellular radios and Apple’s MagSafe charging that lets you mount your phone and charge wirelessly at potentially faster speeds than standard wireless chargers. <em>Verge</em> Score: <a>9 out of 10</a></p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone SE</a> (2020)</h3></div>\\n<div><p>You’d be forgiven if you mistook this second-generation iPhone SE for an iPhone 8. They’re essentially the same size and shape, but the updated iPhone SE benefitted from better performance and a slightly better camera that included portrait mode. The first iPhone SE from 2016 had a cult following for its small size, but the second-generation SE instead switched to the larger 4.7-inch size of more recent iPhones. What the new SE did mirror from its predecessor was the inclusion of modern specs at a cheap price — starting at $399. <em>Verge</em> Score: <a>8.5 out of 10</a></p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max</a> (2019)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone went <em>Pro</em> for the first time with the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max in 2019. These iPhones were the spiritual successors of the iPhone XS and XS Max, but instead of just two cameras, they added a third one for ultrawide shots. The 11 Pros came with an 18W fast charger and a USB-C to Lightning cable out of the box. The rear of the iPhone 11 Pro model is glass, but instead of a glossy finish, it was matte — and it came in a striking midnight green color. <em>Verge</em> Score: <a>9 out of 10</a></p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 11</a> (2019)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone 11 borrowed the iPhone XR’s form factor, but this time, Apple made it the year’s main-line device. Apple added a new ultrawide camera that let you fit more in a photo scene, and it offered multiple colors like with the XR. The cost of entry dropped to $699, too, though it still came with a small 64GB of storage. <em>Verge</em> Score: <a>9 out of 10</a></p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone XR</a> (2018)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>While the iPhone X released alongside the legacy-style iPhone 8, the XS didn’t get an iPhone 9 as a running mate. Instead, Apple introduced the iPhone XR. This lower-end model traded the premium stainless steel chassis of the XS for colorful aluminum, dropped the telephoto camera and 3D Touch, and downgraded the screen to LCD instead of OLED. But the iPhone XR still gave users a big screen, Face ID, the latest processor, and excellent battery life. At a reasonable $749 starting price, the iPhone XR was excellent value for the money. <em>Verge</em> Score: <a>8 out of 10</a></p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone XS and XS Max</a> (2018)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Photo by James Bareham / The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone XS looked similar to the previous year’s iPhone X with minor improvements, but this time, Apple made a plus-sized “Max” version with a huge 6.5-inch display. Apple was once slow to build larger iPhones, but with the iPhone XS Max, it eagerly embraced them. This became the era where Apple associated bigger screens with top-of-the-line features. All that was missing was the “Pro” moniker. <em>Verge</em> Score: <a>8.5 out of 10</a></p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone X</a> (2017)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Photo by James Bareham / The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone X (that’s 10, folks) broke the visual mold of every iPhone before it by shedding the physical home button and adding an edge-to-edge OLED display to an all-new stainless steel chassis. It was the first to include Face ID biometrics instead of a fingerprint reader and introduced silly Animoji characters for iMessage that can mirror your facial expressions. It didn’t come cheap: the iPhone X started at $999 — an unfortunately successful market test that forever inflated premium smartphone prices. <em>Verge</em> Score: <a>9 out of 10</a></p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 8 and 8 Plus</a> (2017)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Photo by James Bareham / The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus weren’t Apple’s revolutionary new takes to mark 10 years of iPhone. Instead, they were refreshes of the company’s hugely successful 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch form factors that began with the iPhone 6. Both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus could easily have been an S update of the iPhone 7 models — with just improved cameras and processors and an all-glass rear to accommodate new wireless charging coils. All that’s fine, though, because these models released under the shadow of the iPhone that’s actually fit to represent 10 years of iPhone. <em>Verge</em> score: <a>8 out of 10</a>.</p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 7 and 7 Plus</a> (2016)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Photo by James Bareham / The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus refined what the iPhone 6S offered by adding better cameras and water resistance — but avoided a complete redesign. The plus model included a new dual-camera system that added 2x zoom and a Portrait Mode that enabled a virtual shallow depth-of-field on subjects. Both models dropped the mechanical home button in favor of a fully digital lookalike, and, yes, the headphone jack was removed. Apple called it “courage,” while critics called it arrogance. Either way, there was no going back. <em>Verge</em> score: <a>9 out of 10</a>.</p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone SE</a> (2016)</h3></div>\\n<div><p>The beginning of 2016 brought a surprise: the midcycle iPhone SE — a $399 device that looked exactly like the two-and-a-half-year-old iPhone 5S but with speedy new hardware inside. It was the company’s first real attempt to add an affordable entry iPhone option after the not-so-inexpensive iPhone 5C. The four-inch screen was perfect for people who didn’t quite feel ready to move on to a larger device,\\xa0but it was clear Apple thought big iPhones were the future. <em>Verge</em> score: <a>8.7 out of 10</a>.</p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 6S and 6S Plus</a> (2015)</h3></div>\\n<div><p>Another S year meant another Similar-looking iPhone. The glass was tougher, and the aluminum case was less prone to bending on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, but not much else had changed. The 6S phones added a pressure-sensitive display called 3D Touch that allowed you to quickly access menus and previews by pushing into the screen until it “popped” with haptic feedback. It was a clever feature but had some learning complexity, and Apple would drop the feature from other iPhones four years later. <em>Verge</em> score: <a>9 out of 10</a>.</p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 6</a> and <a>6 Plus</a> (2014)</h3></div>\\n<div><p>In 2014, Apple finally went big with the iPhone, introducing the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus. Both phones featured a new design with curved edges, introduced NFC support for mobile payments, and included improved cameras —\\xa0which had become the iPhone’s standout feature. The larger, lighter phones weren’t as sturdy as previous models, though, and “Bendgate” was the Apple scandal of 2014. <em>Verge</em> score: <a>9 out of 10</a> (iPhone 6), <a>8.7 out of 10</a> (iPhone 6 Plus).</p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 5C</a> (2013)</h3></div>\\n<div><p>2013 marked the first time Apple announced two iPhones in one day. The cheaper of the two was the colorful iPhone 5C, which had similar specs to the prior year’s iPhone 5 but came with a polycarbonate shell that was famously described by designer Jony Ive as “unapologetically plastic.” At $549, investors were worried that the price wasn’t low enough to compete with lower-cost Android devices, and the phone was seen as a relative failure compared to the iPhone 5S.\\xa0<em>Verge</em> score:\\xa0<a>8.5 out of 10</a>.</p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 5</a> (2012)</h3></div>\\n<div><p>The second major redesign of the iPhone had its screen grow to four inches, following the smartphone market that was trending toward larger devices. It was still compact and easy to handle with one hand and was built with an aluminum chassis that lightened the device but remained durable. The iPhone 5 also introduced the reversible Lightning connector, replacing the old 30-pin port. <em>Verge</em> score: <a>8.8 out of 10</a>.</p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 5S</a> (2013)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Photo by Michael Shane / The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone 5S retained the 5’s design but replaced the home button with Touch ID, Apple’s fingerprint scanner, which was influential enough to make fingerprint scanners a standard feature across the smartphone industry. The device featured the first 64-bit processor in a smartphone with the A7 chip. It also shipped with iOS 7, a major overhaul of Apple’s mobile operating system that dropped various skeuomorphic design touches (like fake textures in apps) for a flatter, cleaner look.\\xa0<em>Verge</em> score: <a>8.8 out of 10</a>.</p></div>\\n<div><h3>\\n<a>iPhone 4S</a> (2011)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Image: The Verge</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The fifth-generation iPhone looked identical to its predecessor but shipped with Siri — Apple’s voice assistant, which was ahead of its time but a little too ambitious. The phone also came with a new, rear-facing 8-megapixel camera and redesigned antenna to fix connectivity problems that plagued the iPhone 4. It was unveiled on October 4th; Apple founder Steve Jobs died the following day. <em>Verge</em> score: <a>8.6 out of 10</a>.</p></div>\\n<div><h3>iPhone 4 (2010)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Image: Apple</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The first major redesign of the iPhone bought stainless steel and glass to the table as well as a new squarer look with rounded corners. It was unveiled as the thinnest smartphone in the world and was the first Apple device to use a “Retina display.” It was also the first iPhone with a front-facing camera for making FaceTime video calls, and it shipped with iOS 4, which was capable of multitasking apps.</p></div>\\n<div><h3>iPhone 3GS (2009)</h3></div>\\n<div><div><div> <cite>Image: Apple</cite>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The first “S” model iPhone offered iterative improvements rather than big new features. Apple said it was twice as fast as its predecessor, with the “S” standing for speed. It retained the same basic shape as earlier models, including a 3.5-inch, 480 x 320 display.

It introduced the classic grid of icons, the single home button, and dropped a physical keyboard —\\xa0a standard for smartphones at the time — in favor of a multitouch display. It was ready for the internet and consuming media, but it still lacked a number of key features, including 3G connectivity and the App Store.</p></div>\\n</div>\\n<div><button><svg><title>Comments</title></svg></button></div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div><div>\\n<div>Most Popular</div>\\n<div>Most Popular</div>\\n<ol>\\n<li><a><h2>This is Lunar Lake — Intel’s utterly overhauled AI laptop chip that ditches memory sticks</h2></a></li>\\n<li><a><h2>Palmer Luckey is now selling pixel-perfect ultrabright magnesium Game Boys for $199</h2></a></li>\\n<li><a><h2>Here’s Jensen Huang signing a woman’s chest</h2></a></li>\\n<li><a><h2>X has new rules that officially allow porn now</h2></a></li>\\n<li><a><h2>Apple’s ‘I’m a Mac’ guy returns to promote Windows on Arm PCs</h2></a></li>\\n</ol>\\n</div></div>\\n<div><aside><div><div><form><div>\\n<div>\\n<h2>Verge Deals</h2>\\n<p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<fieldset><div>\\n<label>Email (required)</label><button>Sign up</button>\\n</div></fieldset>\\n<div>By submitting your email, you agree to our <a>Terms</a> and <a>Privacy Notice</a>.

and in the third part of our Psychology of Shopping series, we hear her story.</p>\\n<p>Maddy says she didn\\'t tell anyone about her out-of-control spending.</p>\\n<p>\"I knew what I was doing was wrong but I felt really ashamed of the fact I was just spending money all the time,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>Only her housemates knew she was struggling because she was unable to pay the bills, but even they didn\\'t know the true extent of her debt and Maddy found herself \"hiding\" from them because she owed them money.</p>\\n<p>Miles from home and feeling alone, Maddy stopped speaking to her parents for a long time as she felt \"ashamed\" and didn\\'t want them to \"bear the burden of having to bail me out\".</p>\\n<p>All the while her spending sprees continued.</p>\\n<p>Maddy explains that much of it was borne out of wanting people to like her - she thought if she had the trendiest clothes and was going out drinking then she\\'d be popular.</p>\\n<p>But she\\'d wake up hungover from a night out and \"spiral\", then go out and buy more clothes.</p>\\n<p>When the debt became too overwhelming, she stopped opening her post and moved to a different city in an attempt to get away from it.</p>\\n<p>It even got to the point where a bailiff turned up at her house, which she described as a \"horrible situation\".</p>\\n<p>In desperation she turned to the Citizen\\'s Advice Bureau, which told her she would have to go bankrupt - an idea that only filled her with \"more shame\".</p>\\n<p>It was then that Maddy decided to finally sort things out.</p>\\n<p>Citizen\\'s Advice told her about the 50-30-20 rule - where you spend\\xa050% of your incomings on rent and everyday bills, 30% on wants and needs, and 20% on debt.</p>\\n<p>Given it would still have taken her about 60 years to clear her debt this way, Maddy says instead she adopted her own 50-10-40 rule - which gave her just 10% of her incomings for food and socialising.</p>\\n<p>She was living on just £15 a week for food so learned to pick up only yellow sticker deals from the supermarket, which would lead to some \"random\" meals.</p>\\n<p>\"I discovered I really love tinned tomatoes on toast with cheese so I lived on that solidly for about two years,\" Maddy says.</p>\\n<p>Now, Maddy has launched an app called <a>Mad About Money</a> to help others - particularly those who are neurodivergent - achieve their money and wellbeing goals.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>She says if she had been taught about money at a young age, she would\\'ve realised the \"massive consequences\" of her spending.</p>\\n<p>\"The whole reason I set up the app is to give people that education and a support community - if they don’t want to talk to their friends, they can come and talk to people who are in similar situations so everyone can cheer each other on,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>\"If other people had said to me, we\\'re in the same position, we\\'re doing the same thing, I wouldn\\'t have felt as ashamed about it.\"</p>\\n<p>Looking back on what happened to her, she says it\\'s \"part of my story so I don\\'t regret it\" and it has taught her a lot, though she does regret putting her parents under stress and not talking to them sooner.</p>\\n<p>She now talks openly with her children about money so they can make more educated decisions.</p>\\n<p>As for the urge to spend money so that people like her?</p>\\n<p>\"I\\'ve loads of friends now - I rock up in joggers half the time and they don\\'t care,\" she laughs.</p>\\n<p><b>Join us tomorrow as we conclude this series with a look at the tactics big brands use to get you to spend more</b></p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div><time><div>06:11:33</div></time></div>\\n<div>\\n<div>Top chef shares his take on an Italian classic</div>\\n<div>\\n<p><b>Every Wednesday we ask Michelin chefs to pick their favourite Cheap Eats where they live and when they cook at home.\\xa0This week we speak to\\xa0Richard Craven from one-starred\\xa0<a>The Royal Oak</a> in Warwickshire.\\xa0</b></p>\\n<p><b>Hi Richard</b><b>, c</b><b>an you tell us your favourite places in Warwickshire</b><b>where you can get a meal for two for less than £40?</b></p>\\n<p>I have two great local spots, one for brunch and one for dinner. They both support sustainable and regenerative farming and use the brilliant Tamworth pork from our neighbour Paddock Farm.</p>\\n<p>For brunch or lunch it has to be <a>The Straw Kitchen at Whichford Pottery</a>. The kitchen offers classic brunch dishes with homemade relishes and home-grown leaves and super interesting and healthy salads with a great range of meaty and vegetarian options. My go-to treat would be the bacon sandwich.</p>\\n<p>The second is <b><a>The Copper Grill</a></b>, which recently opened within our local, The Black Horse, Shipston-on-Stour. The burgers are incredible.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>The bacon double-cheese burger is my favourite, but there are a great range that pair well with the selection of beers that the landlord, Gabe, keeps.</p>\\n<p>Living in the countryside with a sparse population means we don\\'t have a lot of fast-food options, so to find something independently owned and a massive cut above the chains makes this a winner.</p>\\n<p><b>What\\'s your go-to cheap meal at home?</b></p>\\n<p>I trained under Italian chefs at the start of my career, so pasta has always been a favourite fast food for me.</p>\\n<p>At this time of year, it would have to be wild garlic pesto, with either fresh or dried supermarket pasta.</p>\\n<p>Throw a couple handfuls of wild garlic leaves into a food processor, with a handful of both walnuts and pine nuts that have been toasted, a handful of parmesan or an English alternative, such as Old Winchester, and blend with a glug of olive oil. Toss with the cooked pasta and it\\'s done.</p>\\n<p>I usually do a larger batch and keep it in an airtight jar in the fridge.</p>\\n<p><b>How did you get into cheffing?</b></p>\\n<p>I went to school in Chipping Campden and started washing up in kitchens, simply because it was warmer and better paid than my paper round.</p>\\n<p>I quickly realised if everything was clean and tidy, I would get something more interesting to do and that was the spark.</p>\\n<p>I really loved the environment and ended up going full time at 18.</p>\\n<p><b>We\\'ve spoken to lots of top chefs and bloggers - check out their Cheap Eats from around the country here...</b></p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div><time><div>06:04:51</div></time></div>\\n<div>\\n<div>Analysis: Enjoy the boost to your holiday pound while you can</div>\\n<div>\\n<p>If, as expected, the European Central Bank cuts its main policy rate tomorrow it will be a hugely significant moment.</p>\\n<p>At a very basic level, the cut - the ECB is expected to trim its deposit rate from 4% to 3.75% - should benefit millions of households and businesses across the eurozone, who have never known interest rates this high since the single currency was born 25 years ago.</p>\\n<p>British tourists venturing to the usual summer hotspots should also benefit as the pound could grow against the euro, though it is fair to say the foreign exchange markets have been pricing in a rate cut for a while. The pound has risen by 1.5% against the euro since mid-April.</p>\\n<p>But the move will be significant in terms of what it says about central banks around the world. It will be the first time in relatively normal circumstances since before the Ukraine war in which the ECB (or the Bundesbank, the most important central bank in Europe prior to European monetary union) has cut before the US Fed.</p>\\n<p>It is important to note at this point that the ECB is far from being the only central bank whose monetary policy is diverging away from that of the Fed - those in Sweden and Switzerland have done so, and Canada is expected to do so today. In the UK, the Bank of England is expected to begin cutting interest rates in August while the Fed, by contrast, is now not expected to begin cutting until the final three months of the year.</p>\\n<p>Divergence in monetary policy from the Federal Reserve does not come without risks.</p>\\n<p>In particular, there will be concerns about what an early ECB rate cut will mean for the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar. All other things being equal, it should weaken the single currency, making the price of exports from the eurozone to the US more competitive.</p>\\n<p>However, that comes with risks, not least in terms of pushing up the cost of imports - particularly energy, which is priced in dollars, which could in turn push up inflation. A weaker euro would also carry risks in a US election year in which both Joe Biden and Donald Trump, his challenger, will be seeking to out-bid each other with protectionist policies.</p>\\n<p>As Mohamed El-Erian, adviser to Allianz and Gramercy and one of the world\\'s most experienced investors, wrote in the Financial Times last week: \"Too large and persistent a\\xa0divergence\\xa0in rates risks weakening European currencies beyond the point where possible competitive advantages compensate for the costs of higher imported inflation.</p>\\n<p>\"In a US election year, this could also fan protectionist tendencies that, already, are on the cusp of intensifying. The two together would risk financial instability that would spill back to amplify economic concerns.\"</p>\\n<p>For that reason, most market-watchers do not expect this divergence in monetary policy to extend too far. Strategists at BlackRock, the world\\'s biggest asset manager, told clients in a note this week: \"Falling inflation and 18 months of weak economic activity make the case for the ECB to start cutting rates. But we don\\'t think it will cut far and fast.</p>\\n<p>\"Likewise in the US, we see just one or two Fed cuts this year. This is not your typical rate-cutting cycle.</p>\\n<p>\"Investors may see opportunities in further policy divergence, but we think it will be temporary as both central banks ultimately keep rates high for longer.\"</p>\\n<p>So the message for households and businesses in the eurozone is this - while your borrowing costs are about to come down, they may not come down as much as you would like them to.</p>\\n<p>That also applies to Britons hitting the sun-loungers in Spain, Greece and elsewhere this summer.

Do I stay and get the maternity pay and then just figure it out? Or do I have another option?\"</p>\\n<p>She spent weeks going through her finances, talking to her husband and working out how much she needed to save to figure out if leaving her job was even a viable option.</p>\\n<p>\"We\\'ve been told by society that once you\\'re pregnant you\\'re at a disadvantage for so long that we believe it ourselves and we don\\'t move from our careers,\" Jenn says.</p>\\n<p>\"But saying that, we all have responsibilities. I have a mortgage to pay. I have another child. I can\\'t just quit my job, I\\'m not a millionaire.\"</p>\\n<p>She looked at what she spent \"down to the penny\", calculated the minimum amount her family needed a month and saved 10 months of mortgage payments.</p>\\n<p>\"It\\'s really important to know that because when you have a family and a mortgage, you need to manage your own life as well and when starting a business, it\\'s really important to make sure you have all of those optics clear,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>Ultimately, she decided to take the leap with her co-founders, Aisling and Mica, and the trio started hustling.</p>\\n<p>\"We were all at different crossroads in our life and wanted to do more good for the world,\" Jenn says.</p>\\n<p>\"We wanted to help business make a better impact.\"</p>\\n<p><b>\\'I delivered my last project days before birth\\'</b></p>\\n<p>Jenn worked right up until she gave birth in February 2021 and after a few months, she was back full-time.</p>\\n<p>\"We set the business up in December 2020, and started our first project as a team. I was giving birth in February 2021, so I had a timeline, but I delivered my last project five days before I gave birth,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>So far, the company hasn\\'t taken any outside investment and Jenn still hasn\\'t drawn a salary matching what she used to earn.</p>\\n<p>\"We\\'re going on a slower trajectory at the moment but finances are always tough on your business,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>\"You get these waves of great business, you\\'re making money and then you have your downtime, so it\\'s about starting and making sure you review your finances enough that you understand when those waves are going to happen.\"</p>\\n<p><b>Four-day week and championing women</b></p>\\n<p>While focusing on sustainability, Cyd Connects has also centred itself on building a working environment built for women by women, and has invested in a four-day 32-hour work week for all staff.</p>\\n<p>It also offers discounts to companies that are majority owned by women or an under-served group.</p>\\n<p>\"I faced a lot of barriers in my career because I\\'m an Asian woman and people don\\'t realise they\\'re being biased towards women,\" Jenn says.</p>\\n<p>\"If the majority of your workforce is women, but then all of a sudden senior leadership is not, there\\'s a reason why that\\'s happening.</p>\\n<p>\"A lot of businesses aren\\'t really willing to face that yet, and we really wanted to become a champion for women. It\\'s really important for me. I have a daughter, I want things to change for the future.\"</p>\\n<p><b>The challenges</b></p>\\n<p>Like any business, setting up Cyd Connects has come with its challenges, and Jenn says being a woman was part of that.</p>\\n<p>\"I think a lot of women have imposter syndrome. When I started the business, I didn\\'t even call myself CEO at first,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>\"I was like, should I call myself a CEO? I really had to take that thinking away and say I am running this business. I am a CEO.\"</p>\\n<p>Another obstacle came from the bias around women\\'s financial knowledge.</p>\\n<p>\"I had worked in marketing for a long time, and I was often told by the CEOs and finance directors that I didn\\'t understand the finances well enough,\" Jenn says.</p>\\n<p>\"I think women are often told that they don\\'t know them and that is a kind of bias against us because we can understand finances as well as anyone.\"</p>\\n<p>She adds: \"You don\\'t realise that it\\'s happening in the moment... But actually, when I look back, I realise that it was just an easy thing to say to me, to not promote me into a position.\"</p>\\n<p><b>Jenn\\'s advice</b></p>\\n<p>While every woman can run a business, Jenn says, those who are successful need to have a real passion for what they\\'re doing - and be realistic.</p>\\n<p>\"It\\'s a lot of work. It\\'s hard and you\\'re not getting paid for that hard work,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>\"No one starts a business and is just making tonnes of money.\"</p>\\n<p>Another tip is to be prepared mentally and organised in your personal life.</p>\\n<p>\"You can definitely do it, you just need to get yourself ready for it,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>Lastly, part of the process means you have to just \"go with the flow\".</p>\\n<p>\"Things are going to go up and down. It\\'s going to be quite a journey,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>\"But as long as you are realise that\\'s going to happen and you\\'re open to it, I feel like you can really fly with starting a business.\"</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div><time><div>10:55:45</div></time></div>\\n<div>\\n<div>How much the M&amp;S and Sainsbury\\'s bosses earn</div>\\n<div>\\n<p>Company records have revealed the bosses of M&amp;S and Sainsbury\\'s were paid about £5m each last year.</p>\\n<p>M&amp;S chief executive Stuart Machin received a record £4.73m payout - a 75% increase on his earnings the previous year.</p>\\n<p>Of this, £908,000 was fixed pay while the rest was performance-related.</p>\\n<p>Co-chief executive Katie Bickerstaffe, who has a four-day working pattern, took home a £4.41m payout.</p>\\n<p>Her earnings were 85% higher than last year.</p>\\n<p>The pair have overseen a successful turnaround for the retailer, which saw its profits surge by 58% in the 52 weeks to 30 March.</p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, Sainsbury\\'s chief executive Simon Roberts took home £4.91m in the last year - a dip of 5.8% on last year\\'s payout.</p>\\n<p>Mr Roberts\\'s base salary increased by 3.8% to £933,000, but his bonus decreased.</p>\\n<p>Sainsbury\\'s saw its pre-tax profit rise by 1.6%.</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div></section>\\n</div></div>\\n</div>\\n</div></div></main><footer><h2>Sky News footer</h2>\\n<div>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li><a><span>Facebook</span></a></li>\\n<li><a><span>X</span></a></li>\\n<li><a><span>YouTube</span></a></li>\\n<li><a><span>Instagram</span></a></li>\\n</ul></div>\\n<div>\\n<section><h3>About Sky News</h3>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li><a>About Us</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News Profiles</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News International</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News Library Sales</a></li>\\n<li><a>Site Map</a></li>\\n<li><a>Editorial Guidelines</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News Board</a></li>\\n</ul></div></section><section><h3>Sky News Services</h3>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li><a>Sky News RSS</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News For Your Phone</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News Radio</a></li>\\n</ul></div></section><section><h3>Sky Channels</h3>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li><a>Sky Witness</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Atlantic</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Arts</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Cinema</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Sports</a></li>\\n</ul></div></section><section><h3>More Sky Sites</h3>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li><a>NOW</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Zero</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Academy Studios</a></li>\\n<li><a>Bigger Picture</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Group</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Bet</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky.com</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News Arabia</a></li>\\n<li><a>Advertise With Us</a></li>\\n</ul></div></section>\\n</div>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li><a>Terms &amp; Conditions</a></li>\\n<li><a>Privacy &amp; Cookies</a></li>\\n<li><a>Privacy Options</a></li>\\n<li><a>Accessibility</a></li>\\n<li><a>Contact Us</a></li>\\n</ul></div>\\n<div><span>© 2024 Sky UK</span></div>\\n</div></footer>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n',\n",

This led to experiments with multitouch, and one of the first prototypes of a finger-controlled tablet was the Model 035. It was a large tablet that looked like a chunky version of an iPad. However, at the same time, mobile phones were just beginning to gain popularity, and Apple made a move that would revolutionize the industry forever.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone was the debut of the touchscreen, which would soon become standard in the world of smartphones. Sure, there had been smartphones available from established manufacturers before, but they had physical keyboards and a much smaller screen. This was one of the main aspects in which the iPhone changed the game. It boasted capacitive touch technology that Apple acquired from a small company known as Fingerworks that had invented it.</p>\\n<h2><strong>The Masterminds</strong></h2>\\n<p>One of the people credited with innovating Apple’s greatest product is Jony Ive. Back then, his team was working on some tablet prototypes. At the same time, other people at the company were focused on the iPod. It was becoming clear that the iPod would soon merge into a cellphone so that people could carry one device that would fulfill both their communication and music needs.</p>\\n<p>That’s why, in 2005, Apple collaborated with Motorola to release the Rokr E1, which was an iTunes phone that could play music bought from the iTunes Music Store. However, it could store just one hundred songs, had a terrible interface, and took too long to transfer songs from a computer. Needless to say, Steve Jobs hated it.</p>\\n<p>This led to the idea to merge the phone and tablet projects. Steve Jobs, Tony Fadell, Jon Rubenstein, and Phil Schiller met with Jony Ive to see a demo of the 035 prototype. They were impressed but also doubtful that the technology would work for a cell phone.</p>\\n<p>A crucial development came in the form of a small test app that used only part of the 035 tablet’s screen. You could scroll on it using a finger.</p>\\n<p>This led to the decision to develop two phones in parallel. This secret phone project was given the code name “Purple,” or just “P.” Within this, the project based on the iPod nano was called the P1, and the other one based on the 035 tablet was codenamed P2. It was an all-new multitouch device that represented a considerable risk on the company’s part because Apple had no experience with smartphone development. They were a successful computer and music company then, and if Project Purple had gone wrong, it could have destroyed the company’s credibility and reputation.</p>\\n<p>The P1 project was led by Fadell, and his team focused on further developing the iPod into a phone. After six months, they produced a working prototype that could make and receive calls using a rotary dial pad on the screen. However, it was a pain to use and had too many limitations, such as it couldn’t surf the net or run apps.</p>\\n<p>After six months of work on the iPod-plus-phone P1, the project was shelved by Steve Jobs, who thought it was better to focus on P2. However, Fadell was skeptical of touch screens, particularly because devices like Palm Pilots were awkward to use.</p>\\n<h2><strong>From Prototype to Phone</strong></h2>\\n<p>After the decision to go ahead with the P2, Jony spearheaded the industrial design, Fadell led engineering, and Forstall, previously looking after Mac OS X, was put in charge of adapting the computer operating system into one for the phone.</p>\\n<p>Jony’s design team worked on the iPhone without even seeing the operating system. They first worked with a blank screen and later had just a picture of the interface with mock icons. Similarly, the software team never got to see the prototype hardware.</p>\\n<p>In fall 2004, Jony’s design team began work on two styles of what would become the iPhone. One prototype was called “Extrudo,” and was led by Chris Stringer. It resembled the iPod mini and was made from a flattened tube of extruded aluminum that could be anodized in different colors.</p>\\n<p>The other design was named “Sandwich,” and was led by Richard Howarth. It was primarily made of plastic and was rectangular with evenly rounded corners. It had a metal band around the midpoint of its body, a centered display on the front, a menu button below the screen, and a speaker slot above the screen.</p>\\n<p>Jony’s team preferred the Extrudo, but it ran into several problems and was eventually shelved. So Apple began moving forward with the Sandwich prototype.</p>\\n<p>However, by 2006, this too was discarded due to design issues, and the team then turned to an old model they’d made earlier but had discarded in favor of Sandwich and Extrudo. This discarded model looked very similar to the iPhone that the world would eventually see. It had an edge-to-edge screen and a single Home button. A gently curved back snapped seamlessly onto the screen. It looked minimalist and elegant while also being functional. Of course, several developments were made before it was ready to be unveiled to the world in June 2007.</p>\\n<h2><strong>Exploring the Specs</strong></h2>\\n<p>The original iPhone was based on the P2 device of the Project Experience Purple (PEP) team at Apple. It was-named M68 and had a 3.5-inch LCD screen at 320×480 with 163 pixels per inch. It also boasted 802.11b.g Wi-Fi, a quad-band 2G EDGE data radio, Bluetooth 2.0 EDR, and a paltry 2-megapixel camera.</p>\\n<p>These specs might fade in comparison to today’s context, but back then, in 2007, it was still <a>revolutionary</a> and kicked off Apple’s trend of giving the world incredible new phones.</p>\\n<p>Under the hood, it was powered by an ARM-based 1176JZ(F)-S processor and PowerVR MBX Lite 3D graphics chip, manufactured by Samsung.</p>\\n<p>The onboard RAM was just 128MB, and the battery was 1400 mAh battery. At launch, it offered two NAND Flash-based storage tiers – 4GB or 8GB.</p>\\n<p>It also included sensors like an accelerometer that could automatically rotate the screen to match device orientation, a proximity sensor that would automatically turn off the display when close to the face, such as when taking a call, and an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness for optimal viewing experience automatically.</p>\\n<p>Lastly, it could be charged and synced to iTunes using the 30-pin connector.</p>\\n<p><em>Before the official release, Steve Jobs accidentally scratched the iPhone screen with the keys in his pocket.</em> This led to Apple teaming up with Corning, who had invented a new, chemically hardened material. This was turned into the Gorilla Glass on the first iPhone.</p>\\n<h2><strong>What about Software?</strong></h2>\\n<p>As for the software side of things, many tweaks happened pre-release. For instance, the split-screen mode for email got canceled after Steve Jobs thought it looked too crowded on the small screen.</p>\\n<p>Since the ‘i’ in iPhone alludes to the internet, the first model of this iconic device came with a relatively full version of Safari, Apple’s renowned browsing experience from Mac. The team also used Google’s location data to create a superb Maps implementation for the mobile device.</p>\\n<p>However, the first iPhone did not have any third-party apps and maxed out at just 16GB of flash memory. It was also exclusive to the AT&amp;T carrier, which had a notoriously slow and unreliable EDGE GSM network.</p>\\n<p>The original iPhone was first shipped on June 28, 2007, and even then, spiraling queues formed outside Apple Stores, particularly the flagship ones such as the glass cube in New York City.</p>\\n<p>Despite the buzz and anticipation, Apple’s competitors were dismissing the hype as temporary. The media dubbed the device as the Jesus Phone!</p>\\n<h2><strong>The Phone that Defined and Defied History</strong></h2>\\n<p>Even though it was just a little over a decade ago, the world was still very different back in 2007. Bandwidth was quite limited and expensive. Moreover, smartphones only appealed to niche user groups and not the masses.</p>\\n<p>The original iPhone sold over 6 million units in its first year on four carriers in four countries. Today, hundreds of millions of iPhones are sold on almost every carrier in almost every country. Apple has diversified into a range of smart tech products and services such as the Apple Watch, Apple TV, CarPlay and AirPlay, AirPods, HomePod, etc.</p>\\n<p>The first iPhone’s successor was the <a>iPhone 3G</a> that boasted 3G functionality, apps, and more. It arrived a year after the first device, which was discontinued the same week. The first generation iPhone was eventually declared obsolete in June 2013, before the launch of the iPhone 5 and 5S.</p>\\n<p>In 2013, a prototype of the first-generation iPhone sold for $1500 on eBay! After all, it’s now a relic of what technology is capable of achieving. Perhaps nobody could have predicted how the iPhone has evolved over the past thirteen years, but Apple and Steve Jobs made a bold move with that first device. The rest, of course, is history.</p>\\n<p><strong>You may like to read:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a>Apple’s First-Ever Laptop: An Origin Story</a></li>\\n<li><a>iPhone History: 10 Most Interesting Facts You Need to Know</a></li>\\n<li><a>The history of the Apple Watch: 6 years and counting…</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<div><div><span><ul><li><div>\\n<div><a>Mehak</a></div> <p>Mehak has a master’s degree in communication and over ten years of writing experience.

Yet the challenges the world faces—energy crises, food shortages, climate change, overpopulation—require collaboration and cooperation from all of us, both as global citizens and nations. These challenges are too complex, interconnected and fast-moving to be solved by any one person, idea, organization or nation. We will need to harness the fundamental principle underpinning all research—to stand on the shoulders of giants, with each new breakthrough building on the work of others before it. The hidden story of the iPhone is a testament to this.</p>\\n<p>The relentless drive and ingenuity of the many teams at Apple cannot be doubted. But there were hundreds of research breakthroughs and innovations without which the iPhone would not even be possible. Each was the result of countless researchers, universities, funders, governments and private companies layering one innovation on top of another.</p>\\n<h2>On supporting science journalism</h2>\\n<p>If you\\'re enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by <a>subscribing</a>. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.</p>\\n<p>To demonstrate this, here’s a closer look at just three of the research breakthroughs that underpin the iPhone.</p>\\n<p><b>THE TOUCH SCREEN</b></p>\\n<p>The iPhone wouldn’t be the iPhone without its iconic touch-screen technology.</p>\\n<p>The first touch screen was actually invented way back in the 1960s by Eric Arthur Johnson, a radar engineer working at a government research center in the U.K. While the Righteous Brothers were losing that lovin’ feeling, Johnson was publishing his findings in an\\xa0<i>Electronics</i><i>Letters</i>article published by the Institution of Engineering and Technology. His 1965 article,\\xa0“<a>Touch display—a novel input/output device for</a><a>computers</a>\"\\xa0continues to be cited by researchers to this day. The 1969 patent that followed has now been cited across a whole host of famous inventions—including Apple’s 1997 patent for “a portable computer handheld cellular telephone.”</p>\\n<p>Since Johnson’s first leap forward, billions of dollars have been awarded to research on touch-screen technology—from public bodies and private investors alike, with one often leading to the other. The\\xa0<a>University of Cambridge</a>, for example, recently spun out a limited company to secure further investment for their own research on touch-screen technology, successfully closing a $5.5m investment round backed by venture capitalists from the U.K. and China.</p>\\n<p>One Apple patent on touch-screen technology cites over 200 scientific peer-reviewed articles, published by a range of academic societies, commercial publishers and university presses. These authors did not work alone. Most were part of a research group. Many were awarded a grant for their research. Each had their article independently evaluated by at least one external academic in the\\xa0<a>peer-</a><a>review</a>\\xa0process that sits at the core of academic research. Consider one article on touch-screen technology recently published by Elsevier’s Information Sciences journal. Six authors and two blind peer reviewers are\\xa0<a>acknowledged</a>. Conservatively extrapolating such figures across the two hundred articles cited by Apple tallies to over a thousand researchers, each making their important contribution to this area of touch-screen technology.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Johnson may have taken the first step, and Apple harnessed its potential, but we owe touch-screen technology to the collective efforts of numerous researchers all over the world.</p>\\n<p><b>THE LITHIUM BATTERY</b></p>\\n<p>Battery Low. Blink, blink. We all know iPhones soak up a lot of power, yet they’d be nowhere without the rechargeable lithium battery.</p>\\n<p>British scientist Stanley Whittingham created the very first example of the lithium battery while working in a lab for ExxonMobil in the ‘70s, carrying forward research he’d initially conducted with colleagues at Stanford University. Previous research had already indicated that lithium could be used to store energy, but it was Whittingham and his team that figured out how to do this at room temperature—without the risk of explosion (<a>Samsung</a>\\xa0take note).</p>\\n<p>A professor at the University of Oxford, John Goodenough, then improved on Whittingham’s original work by using metal oxides to enhance performance. This, in turn, piqued Sony’s interest, which became the first company to commercialize lithium batteries in the 1990s and launched a lithium powered cell phone in Japan in 1991. All of this provided the basis for mass use, with Apple duly obliging when they first launched the iPhone to over a million users in 2007.</p>\\n<p>Lithium’s story doesn’t stop there. As one of the building blocks of a world without fossil fuels, its production is zealously guarded. So who do you think bought Sony’s battery business in 2016? Why, one of Apple’s leading suppliers no less,\\xa0<a><u>Murata Manufacturing</u></a>. Meanwhile, John Goodenough, now 95, continues his groundbreaking research. Only a few months ago he published a landmark\\xa0<a>study</a>\\xa0in the\\xa0<i>Journal of the American Chemical Society</i>. Among its claims? That Goodenough had created a lithium battery for electric cars that can be used 23 times more than the current average.</p>\\n<p><b>THE INTERNET AND THE WORLD WIDE WEB</b></p>\\n<p>When Apple engineer Andy Grignon first added internet functionality to an iPod in 2004, Steve Jobs was far from enthusiastic: “This is bullshit. I don’t want this. I know it works, I got it, great, thanks, but this is a shitty experience.”</p>\\n<p>The painstaking work of multiple Apple teams took a “shitty experience” and made something revolutionary—all collective human experience and knowledge right there, in your back pocket, at the touch of your fingertips. But who do we have to thank for this?</p>\\n<p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee is widely credited with the invention of the World Wide Web. His work began in the 1980s while at the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Better known by its French acronym, CERN was established by 12 European governments in 1952 and continues to be funded by its member states. Berners-Lee’s ideas began as a proposed solution for a very specific problem at CERN: how best to facilitate the sharing and updating of the vast amounts of information and data used by CERN researchers. His proposal was based on the concept of hypertext, a term first coined by the theoretical pioneer Ted Nelson in a 1965 paper published by the\\xa0<a>Association for Computing Machinery</a>. Often compared to an electronic version of the footnoting system used by researchers the world over, hypertext underpins the web, enabling you to jump from one source of information to another. Anywhere on the Internet. In whatever form it may be.</p>\\n<p>But even Berners-Lee cannot be given solo credit. If the World Wide Web is the map, the internet is the landscape we navigate: a networking infrastructure connecting millions of computers globally, enabling each to communicate with the other, transferring vast quantities of information.</p>\\n<p>To trace the origins of the internet we have to return to 1965. While Nelson was coining hypertext and Eric inventing the touch screen, two researchers at MIT, Thomas Merrill and Lawrence Roberts, connected their computer to another 3,000 miles away in California using a simple low-speed dial-up telephone line. Shortly after that came Arpanet, not a dystopian AI system, but the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. Arpanet was established and funded by DARPA, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and initially conceived as a means of interconnecting the American military’s computers across their various regional hubs.</p>\\n<p>It was Arpanet that really gave birth to the internet, in a moment described below by Leonard Kleinrock. It’s October 1969, three months after man has walked on the moon, and Kleinrock and his colleagues have just connected multiple computers across the U.S.:</p>\\n<p><i>We typed the L and we asked on the phone,</i></p>\\n<p><i>Do you see the L?</i></p>\\n<p><i>Yes, we see the L</i></p>\\n<p><i>We typed the O, and we asked, Do you see the O?</i></p>\\n<p><i>Yes, we see the O.</i></p>\\n<p><i>Then we typed the G, and the system crashed…</i></p>\\n<p>The course of true innovation never did run smoothly. But these early breakthroughs of the space age were the basis for all that was to follow. While the modern iPhone is now 120 million times more powerful than the computers that took Apollo 11 to the moon, its real power lies in its ability to leverage the billions of websites and terabytes that make up the internet.</p>\\n<p>A brief analysis of these three research breakthroughs reveals a research web of over 400,000 publications since Apple first published their phone patent in 1997. Add the factor of supporting researchers, funders, universities and companies behind them, and the contributing network is simply awe-inspiring. And we’ve barely scratched the surface. There are countless other research breakthroughs without which the iPhone would not be possible. Some well-known, others less so. Both GPS and Siri had their origins with the U.S. military, while the complex algorithms that enable digitization were initially conceived to detect nuclear testing. All had research at their core.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone is an era-defining technology. Era-defining technologies do not come from the rare brilliance of one person or organization, but layer upon layer of innovation and decade upon decade of research, with thousands of individuals and organizations standing on each other’s shoulders and peering that bit further into the future. In our age of seemingly insurmountable global challenges, we must not only remember this but be inspired by it.</p>\\n<p>We must encourage openness and transparency at the heart of research, ensuring it is disseminated as widely, quickly and clearly as possible. We must remember that every delay and distortion matters. Research integrity and reproducibility, transparent peer review, open access, diversity—these are more than just buzzwords. They are exciting steps toward reforming the infrastructure of a global research ecosystem that has always been our best hope for the future.</p>\\n</div>\\n<footer><div><div><a>Rights &amp; Permissions</a></div></div>\\n<div><div>\\n<div><p><a>Matthew Hayes</a> is the author of \"<a><i>Robert Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis</i></a>,\" published in the journal <i>History</i>.

That was\\xa0the original Apple iPhone.</div>\\n<div>And while the iPhone has changed a lot since its inception, the foundation that was laid at the start was a solid one that ensured success for years to come.

It was the ultimate Apple 3-in-1, but while Apple thought of the original iPhone as a phone first, iPod second and a \\'communicator\\' third, it\\'s interesting how most people would probably rank the \\'communicator\\' aspect as what makes the iPhone and smartphones special.</div>\\n<div>The list of breakthrough innovations in the original iPhone is so long and there is so much history behind each of them that an article (nay, a book) won\\'t be enough to properly describe it, but here is a very short summary:</div>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li>3.5-inch display with a resolution of 320 x 480 pixels</li>\\n<li>iOS, a new multi-touch interface controlled entirely by your finger</li>\\n<li>Internet Connectivity (2G) with native email client and web browser</li>\\n<li>2-megapixel photo camera with NO video recording capabilities</li>\\n<li>Ambient light sensor, proximity sensor</li>\\n<li>On-screen keyboard</li>\\n<li>4GB / 8 GB / 16GB storage models</li>\\n<li>YouTube and Google Maps applications, Google Search</li>\\n<li>iPod music / video player with support for iTunes</li>\\n</ul></div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<h2><span>iPhone 3G</span></h2>\\n<div>\\n<div><span>July 2008</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 3G Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 3G Review</a>\\n</div>Just a day before the launch of Apple\\'s second-generation handset, the iPhone 3G, on July 10th, 2008, the App Store officially opened for business. It was made available on the original iPhone, of course, and in hindsight it was clearly as big of an event as the phone launch itself.</div>\\n<div>The iPhone 3G kept the same screen size as the original, but went with a new, glossy plastic design and added 3G connectivity, making it much faster to load web pages. The iPhone 3G was also the first iPhone with GPS, the satellite communication that allows your phone to know its exact position and a quintessential part of a better maps and navigation experience.</div>\\n<div>The iPhone 3G did away with the 4GB storage option and was only available in an 8GB and 16GB versions. This new iPhone also fixed an important oversight: the 3.5mm jack on the original iPhone was deeply flawed, it was way too recessed inside the body of the device and this made actually using many headphones impossible without an adapter (ah, the irony!). Apple itself admitted on its website for the OG iPhone that \"some stereo headphones may require an adapter (sold separately) to ensure proper fit.\"</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div>\\n<h2><span>iPhone 3GS</span></h2>\\n<div><span>June 2009</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 3GS Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 3GS Review</a>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>The iPhone 3GS was a gradual upgrade rather than a radical move, but it still brought important speed improvements and faster 3G connectivity.</div>\\n<div>The S in 3GS stood for speed, as the phone was more powerful, zippier, but its most important novelty was probably that it was the first iPhone that could record video. The iPhone 3GS\\' new 3-megapixel camera debuted a video mode and was able to record videos at VGA (480p) resolution.</div>\\n<div>It was also the first iPhone with a digital compass that allowed it to correctly show you your orientation in space in Maps.</div>\\n<div>The rest of the innovation here was a lot about software: core features like copy and paste, push notifications, landscape keyboard and more arrived in 2009.</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<h2><span>iPhone 4</span></h2>\\n<div><span>June 2010</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 4 Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 4 Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>For many Apple customers, the iPhone 4 was the <span>best iPhone</span> design of all time. The iPhone 4 was the first major redesign within the iPhone series, introducing a stunning for the time glass construction with a metal frame. It was also the first iPhone to come with a \\'Retina\\' display, a new screen resolution of 640 x 960 pixels that was so sharp Apple said it compares to the the natural limits of the human retina. This was the first phone with such a high resolution and it remained so for the next couple of years.</div>\\n<div>There was also a big scandal around the iPhone 4, the so-called antenna-gate. The issue was that when held a certain way, cellular signal got easily blocked by your hand and while Apple never formally fixed this, it did offer free bumpers that alleviated the issue.</div>\\n<div>The list of innovations in the iPhone 4 is too long, so we\\'ll just quickly go through the most important ones right below:</div>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li>Highest phone resolution of the time, \\'Retina\\' display</li>\\n<li>First iPhone with a front-facing, selfie camera</li>\\n<li>New 5-megapixel camera capable of 720p HD video recording</li>\\n<li>Smaller, micro-SIM card slot</li>\\n<li>New glass-and-metal design</li>\\n<li>Secondary mic for noise cancellation</li>\\n</ul></div>\\n<div>A few months after its launch on AT&amp;T, Apple\\'s exclusive partner, the iPhone 4 finally launched on <a>Verizon</a> Wireless in the beginning of 2011.</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div><h2><span>iPhone 4s</span></h2></div>\\n<div><span>September 2011</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 4s Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 4s Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>2011 was probably the toughest and saddest year for Apple, its fans and the community: on October 5th, 2011, just a day after the introduction of the iPhone 4s, <span>Steve Jobs</span>, the man that created Apple, shaped it as a company and single-handedly led it with his unique vision for technology passed away. Jobs left <a>Tim Cook</a>, Apple\\'s former logistics chief as the CEO, and Cook hosted the iPhone 4s unveiling.</div>\\n<div>The big feature of the iPhone 4s was Siri, the smart voice assistant that impressed with its ability to ask tricky questions with a pinch of humor and who would console you with a joke when you need it. It also set alarms and calendar appointments. The newer iPhone, however, remained a 3.5-inch phone, smaller than the Android competition that was getting a foothold among customers who wanted bigger devices.</div>\\n<div>The iPhone 4s debuted with a new, two-antenna design and fixed the dreadful \\'antenna-gate\\' problems of the iPhone 4. The major new features introduced with the iPhone 4s included a more powerful, dual-core chip, the Apple A5, a new 8-megapixel camera capturing more detailed pictures, with better white balance, and iCloud, a cloud-storage solution.</div>\\n<div>In October 2011, Sprint also finally got the rights to sell Apple\\'s iPhone and started offering the iPhone 4s, iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS to its customers.</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div>\\n<h2><span>iPhone 5</span></h2>\\n<div><span>September 2012</span></div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 5 Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 5 Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>The Apple iPhone 5 brought a slightly bigger and taller display than previous iPhones, but it was not the radical change that many users expected: it grew from 3.5 inches to 4 inches in screen size, and with it came a 16:9 aspect ratio (different from the 3:2 used before), which proved to be more practical for video, traditionally shot in 16:9.</div>\\n<div>The iPhone 5 also marked a monumental moment for Apple: it was the first phone with a chip that Apple itself made as it sought independence from Qualcomm. The Apple A5 impressed with its design and speed improvements, and set an important foundation. Apple was now able to better optimize the performance of its phone to the chip that it itself made. The new iPhone 5 design was also thinner and lighter.</div>\\n<div>It was - finally! - the first iPhone with 4G LTE support. The display was also improved in terms of color, it was well-balanced for the sRGB standard used across the web for images and video.</div>\\n<div>This was also the time when iOS software chief Scott Forstall was shown the door as the newly-launched Apple Maps app, a project that he led, failed spectacularly at start. This would later lead to a huge change in the iOS interface that would move from the old-fashioned skeuomorphic design.Months after the launch of the iPhone 5, the last big U.S. carrier finally got the rights to sell it: <a>T-Mobile</a> joined AT&amp;T, <span>Verizon</span> Wireless and Sprint in carrying the iPhone. This was around the time when John Legere started the massive change at <span>T-Mobile</span> and grew it to where it is now.</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<h2><span>iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c</span></h2>\\n<div><span>September 2013</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 5s Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 5s Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 5c Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 5c Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>As competitors had already moved to bigger-screen phones as the standard, all eyes were on Apple in late 2013. Everyone expected a bigger phone, but the company was not yet ready to show that. What it had up its sleeve was the iPhone 5s, which featured the same size and design.</div>\\n<div>Yet still, this was an important \\'S\\' update with two key features that were years ahead of the competition: a new Apple A7 \\'Cyclone\\' chip, the first 64-bit chip on a phone, years before others even had started work on 64-bit chips, and then also \\'Touch ID\\', the fingerprint-based secure identification system that would take years to properly implement on <a>Android phones</a>. It also brought improvements to low-light camera performance and other minor enhancements.</div>\\n<div>The iPhone 5s also marks a new era for iOS: in June 2013 at WWDC, Apple announced a radical change to the iOS design with iOS 7. The new Jony Ive-designed interface did away with the old-fashioned elements in iOS in favor of a flatter, transparency-rich interface that felt like a huge step forward.</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>Let\\'s also not forget about the iPhone 5c, the colorful plastic iPhone with an affordable price that many people bought.</div>\\n<div>\\n<div>\\n<h2><span>iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus</span></h2>\\n<div><span>September 2014</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 6 Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 6 Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 6 Plus Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 6 Plus Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div><div>\\n<a><p>iPhone 6 (left), iPhone 6 Plus (center) and iPhone 5s (right)</p></a><a><p>iPhone 6 (left) and iPhone 6 Plus (right)</p></a>\\n</div></div>\\n<div>In 2015, after years of waiting, Apple - finally! - showed an iPhone with a bigger screen. In fact, there was two of them: the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus.</div>\\n<div>The pair sold like hotcakes: it brought both a Galaxy S and a Galaxy Note competitor, but it was also clearly better designed, with a thin and streamlined, durable aluminum body. It felt on another level than the cheap-feeling plastic designs from Samsung. It\\'s safe to say now that the iPhone 6 was an important step towards establishing premium, metal designs as the standard among flagships.</div>\\n<div>The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus also introduced a much better camera with faster auto-focusing and support for continuous auto-focus in videos.</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>There was a change in storage options: the iPhone 6 base model was still a 16GB one, but there were 64GB and 128 gig options for more demanding users.</div>\\n</div>\\n<div><div>\\n<div><h2><span>iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus</span></h2></div>\\n<div><span>September 2015</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 6s Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 6s Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 6s Plus Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 6s Plus Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div><div>\\n<a><p>iPhone 6s with its new 3D Touch system</p></a><a><p>iPhone 6s Plus</p></a>\\n</div></div>\\n<div>After going on a crusade for thicker iPhones, in 2015, for the first time, Apple actually increased the thickness of its new iPhones. The main reason for the thicker body of the new iPhones was a new display technology that allowed the phone to sense the force of a touch. Apple called the tech 3D Touch and introduced it to a lot of its own apps. It all worked a bit as a right click, a neat time-saving shortcut for many apps.</div>\\n<div>The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were the first iPhones able to record 4K video. <span>Android phones</span> had come with 4K video for years, but all of them had annoying limitations such as 5-minute limit to video clips and no ability to edit 4K footage on the phones. The iPhone 6s might have been late, but it got all those things right: video came very crisp, recorded at high bit-rates, and Apple updated its excellent iMovie with support for up to two 4K video channels. At the time, many laptops could not handle 4K video editing, outdone by a phone.</div>\\n<div>Other cool iPhone 6s features included Live Photos that recorded a short video before and after a still image, a set of new 3D Touch-enabled Motion Wallpapers, a new rose gold color, as well as support for \\'Hey, Siri\\', a hands-free voice command that activated the smart iPhone assistant.</div>\\n</div></div>\\n<h2><span>iPhone SE</span></h2>\\n<div><span>April 2016</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone SE Specs</a> | <a>iPhone SE Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>The first-generation <span>iPhone SE</span> brought back the familiar 4-inch form factor from the recent past to the joy of compact phone lovers.</div>\\n<div>But the most remarkable thing about it was the price: it was the first truly affordable iPhone, priced at $400 for the base 16GB model.</div>\\n<div>What was great about the SE was that Apple had equipped it with the same powerful chip as its flagship 6s peers, and a very similarly performing main camera. The biggest compromise had to be made with battery life which was sub-par compared to the bigger models.</div>\\n<div><div>\\n<div><h2><span>iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus</span></h2></div>\\n<div><span>September 2016</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 7 Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 7 Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 7 Plus Specs</a> | <a>iPhone Plus 7 Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>In 2017, two big things happened to the iPhone: Apple killed the headphone jack and both new iPhones got water-proofing. In a \\'courageous\\', typical Apple move, the company killed our good old pal, the 3.5mm headphone jack. The outcry was huge and while it did not affect sales much as the iPhone 7 broke all previous Apple sales records, many people were annoyed by this move.</div>\\n<div>Also, the iPhone 7 Plus for the first time differentiated itself as the more capable camera phone, with a dual camera system where a secondary, \"telephoto\" lens allowed taking zoomed-in photos and applying a new \"Portrait mode\" effect that would blur the background in an image for a professional, DSLR-like look. The little iPhone 7 also got a better camera: it now came with optical image stabilization (OIS), which contributed to more blur-free pictures and better video stabilization.</div>\\n<div>The other big news was the new jet black color that was available in very limited quantities and felt almost like glass, but got scratched extremely easily. A new, matte black color was also available and while not as stunning to look at, it was more practical and less prone to scratches.</div>\\n<div>Apple continued improving the displays of its iPhones as well by introducing a new, wide-color DCI-P3 mode that made everything look more vibrant, more impressive.</div>\\n</div></div>\\n<div>\\n<h2><span>Apple iPhone X, iPhone 8\\xa0and iPhone 8 Plus</span></h2>\\n<div><span>September 2017</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone X Specs</a> | <a>iPhone X Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 8 Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 8 Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 8 Plus Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 8 Plus Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div><div>\\n<a><p>iPhone X and its signature Face ID system and notch</p></a><a><p>iPhone 8 (left), iPhone X (center) and iPhone 8 Plus (right)</p></a>\\n</div></div>\\n<div>Apple introduced a record three new iPhones in 2017 and back then kept the iPhone 7, 6s and SE series available, making its overall portfolio of iPhones the biggest ever offered.</div>\\n<div>This year also marked the first time we saw an iPhone priced at $1,000, much higher than the $750 that Apple typically asked for a Plus sized iPhone before.</div>\\n<div>And the iPhone X was really the iPhone that paved the way for the future: it was the first one with a bezel-less edge-to-edge screen (yes, with the notch) and it was the first with an OLED display. This also meant the demise of Touch ID fingerprint recognition: the brand new Face ID system that recognized your face proved more secure and easier to use.</div>\\n<div>The rest of the iPhone innovation that year was shared between the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: the glass back, the wireless charging, the Apple A11 Bionic chip with its neural engine, as well as the new for the time 64GB and 256GB storage options.</div>\\n</div>\\n<h2><span>iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max</span></h2>\\n<div><span>September 2018</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone XS Specs</a> | <a>iPhone XS Max Specs</a> |\\xa0<a>iPhone XS and XS Max Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone XR Specs</a> | <a>iPhone XR Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div><div>\\n<a><p>iPhone XR (left), iPhone XS Max (center), iPhone XS (right)</p></a><a><p>iPhone XS Max (left), iPhone XS (right)</p></a>\\n</div></div>\\n<div>In late 2018, Apple cemented the tradition of launching three new phones at once, but this time all of the three new phones used the gesture navigation and Face ID systems that were the way for the future of the company.</div>\\n<div>The iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max continued following the example set by the iPhone X: super premium, $1,000 plus prices that Apple tied to the next-generation AMOLED displays it used in these phones, plus both featured a dual camera system with a main and a 2X zoom telephoto lens.</div>\\n<div>The iPhone XR was the most affordable in the series, but still not cheap by traditional smartphone pricing terms with a price starting at $750. The XR introduced a colorful new design with vibrant tonalities for the back of the device. It used larger bezels on the front and Apple opted for the LCD screen technology with a quite low HD+ resolution, but kept the same powerful processor as on the XS series here and also used the very same main camera, factors that combined with the allure of the iOS ecosystem elevated the iPhone XR to become the best selling iPhone of the series.</div>\\n<h2><span>iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max</span></h2>\\n<div><span>September 2019</span></div>\\n<div>\\xa0<a>iPhone 11 Pro Specs</a> |\\xa0<a>iPhone 11 Pro Max Specs</a>\\xa0| <a>iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 11 Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 11 Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>In 2019, Apple again launched three new iPhones that were quite similar to what it had offered in the previous year.</div>\\n<div>The main change was in the camera where all three iPhones received a brand new ultra-wide camera that allowed users to capture incredible landscape photos, as well as shoot in tight spaces.</div>\\n<div>The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max got the \\'Pro\\' moniker that Apple seemed to associate again with their high quality AMOLED screens. In 2019, Apple gave users what users had requested for years: slightly thicker phones with a much, much bigger batteries that finally elevated the Pro and especially the Pro Max to the top of battery life rankings. The other important feature that the phones got was Night Mode, a new camera mode that would have the phone smartly combine a long exposure image with multiple others in an automated, easy process that captured good images in very dim light.</div>\\n<div>The iPhone 11 was again the most popular model in the series. Apple smartly decided to lower its starting price to $700, $50 less than the starting price of the iPhone XR from the preceding year and that move helped further boost the iPhone 11 popularity. Critics, however, pointed out that Apple was still using an old LCD technology and low resolution panel in a phone that costs quite a lot, while the competition was ahead in this regard.</div>\\n<h2><span><span>iPhone SE (2020)</span></span></h2>\\n<div><span>April 2020</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone SE (2020) Specs</a> | <a>iPhone SE (2020) Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>Apple brought back the SE branding in early 2020 just as the coronavirus pandemic unfolded blowing heavy hits to the economy, and the phone was an instant success. Priced at $400 and powered by the latest at the time Apple A13 chip, it was far more powerful than any <span>Android phone</span> in that price range.</div>\\n<div>But the new <span>iPhone SE (2020)</span> wasn\\'t quite as tiny as the original 4-inch SE. Instead, it actually uses an iPhone 8 chassis, so you got a 4.7-inch screen. The single camera on the back was capable of recording 4K videos with great quality and while others also offered an ultra-wide and sometimes even telephoto lenses at this budget, the new SE did stand out with quality of its single lens.</div>\\n<div>The biggest complaint about this phone is to this day the battery life. Having a tiny 1800mAh battery inside meant that if you used your phone a bit more during the day, you would need to recharge it even before you get home from work, which is definitely not a great experience.</div>\\n<h2><span>iPhone 12 Mini, 12, 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max</span></h2>\\n<div><span>October 2020</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 12 Specs</a> |<a>iPhone 12 Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 12 Mini Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 12 Mini Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 12 Pro Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 12 Pro Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 12 Pro Max Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 12 Pro Max Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>In late 2020, Apple for the first time launched four iPhones at pretty much the same time. After years of sticking with similar designs, the 12 series featured a complete refresh in the looks department: flat sides, thin bodies, and a brand new super compact form factor with the <span>iPhone 12 Mini</span>.</div>\\n<div>All four 12 series iPhones come with 5G connectivity, a first for any iPhone, and just as you\\'d expect from Apple that was handled smoothly with support for mmWave in the US, as well as a clever feature that would automatically switch back to LTE networks when 5G ones were not available to conserve battery life.</div>\\n<div>Also, all four now feature OLED displays with beautiful, rich color and deep blacks, while previously the more affordable iPhone 11 model for example compromised on that with an LCD screen.</div>\\n<div>The <a>iPhone 12</a> is currently the best-seller in the series, but the Pro iPhones which stand out mostly for their telephoto cameras and advanced camera features like RAW capture also sell well.</div>\\n<h2><span>iPhone 13 mini, 13, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max</span></h2>\\n<div><span>September 2021</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 13 Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 13 Review</a><a>iPhone 13 Mini Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 13 Mini Review</a><a>iPhone 13 Pro Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 13 Pro Review</a><a>iPhone 13 Pro Max Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 13 Pro Max Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>Despite a global chip shortage, Apple launched its <a>iPhone 13</a> series on time with all four models launching at the same time. The series have not changed and follow the same recipe with a mini, 5.4\" model, two 6.1\" iPhones, and one 6.7\" Pro Max model.</div>\\n<div>The big upgrade in the 2021 family of iPhones is without a doubt the battery increase. All four iPhones ship with bigger batteries than their predecessors with the difference ranging from a 10% increase in the mini to a nearly 20% battery capacity increase in the Pro Max. This has resulted in significant battery life gains with the <span>iPhone 13 Pro Max</span> in particular securing the title of the longest-lasting iPhone ever.</div>\\n<div>On the camera front, Apple introduced Photographic Styles, a way to control the color and contrast of all of your photos, and unlike a filter, you could create a custom look for every photo you take and it would be applied automatically. All four iPhones also come with Cinematic Mode, which records 1080p video where the background is blurred and the camera can automatically rack focus for a cinematic-like effect. The consensus in the community is that Cinematic Mode is cool, but suffers from some artifacts and is not quite fully polished, but can be fun to use nonetheless.</div>\\n<div>The <span>iPhone 13</span> series also brought brighter screens for an easier outdoor use experience, and the infamous notch got 20% smaller. With the bigger batteries, the phones also got physically a bit thicker and heavier too.</div>\\n<h2><span><span>iPhone SE (2022)</span></span></h2>\\n<div><span>March 2022</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone SE (2022) Specs</a> | <a>iPhone SE (2022) Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>Two years after the release of the second generation SE, Apple was ready to introduce a new member to the family: the <span>iPhone SE (2022)</span>.</div>\\n<div>There weren\\'t any high hopes or much hype for this iPhone before the launch, and it was mostly a modest update. The SE (2022) came with the same form factor as the previous <span>iPhone SE</span>, and that design dates back to 2014 and the iPhone 6, so it definitely looked ancient at launch. The problem most reviewers quoted, however, was the small for the times 4.7-inch screen that also happens to use the older LCD technology and has a lower than average resolution.</div>\\n<div>On the flipside, Apple equipped the SE (2022) with the Apple A15 chip. This was not only the fastest processor in a budget phone in 2022, it was the fastest processor on any phone, period. Teardowns also revealed a surpising 10% bump to the battery capacity, unexpected considering the unchanged form factor. This was also the first budget iPhone with 5G connectivity and while the modem did not support mmWave, it had the far more important C band frequencies for wide coverage across the US.</div>\\n<div>Finally, all of that came at a slightly higher, $430 starting price.</div>\\n<h2><span><span>iPhone 14</span>, 14 Plus, 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max</span></h2>\\n<div><span>September 2022</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 14 Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 14 Review</a><a>iPhone 14 Plus Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 14 Plus Review</a><a>iPhone 14 Pro Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 14 Pro Review</a><a>iPhone 14 Pro Max Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 14 Pro Max Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>Apple killed the \"mini\" from its iPhone series and replaced it with the total opposite: a large, 6.7\" <span>iPhone 14</span> Plus.</div>\\n<div>So the <span>iPhone 14</span> lineup consists of an $800 <span>iPhone 14</span>, a $900 <span>iPhone 14 Plus</span>, a $1,000 <span>iPhone 14 Pro</span> and a $1,100 <span>iPhone 14 Pro Max</span>.</div>\\n<div>For the first time ever, the non-Pro versions don\\'t get a new processor and use only a slightly upgraded version of the Apple A15 chip used last year. The <span>iPhone 14 Pro</span> editions do get the new Apple A16 chip, so there is a bigger gap between the vanilla and the Pro versions this year..</div>\\n<div>The design remains mostly the same on the regular version, but there are bigger changes on the Pros. The notch is being replaced by the Dynamic Island, a pill-shaped camera module. It bubbles and pops with notifications and alerts, and is just so well animated and fluid, and such a clever idea. And yes,\\xa0it still support Face ID.</div>\\n<div>The other big news is that the Pro models get an upgrade to a larger-sensor, 48MP main camera. Cinematic Mode now works in 4K too, and supports both 24fps and 30fps.</div>\\n<div>Battery life and charging speeds, however, have not changed in any meaningful way.</div>\\n<h2><span><span>iPhone 15</span>, 15 Plus, 15 Pro and 15 Ultra</span></h2>\\n<div><span>September 2023</span></div>\\n<div>\\n<a>iPhone 15 Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 15 Review</a><a>iPhone 15 Plus Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 15 Plus Review</a><a>iPhone 15 Pro Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 15 Pro Review</a><a>iPhone 15 Pro Max Specs</a> | <a>iPhone 15 Pro Max Review</a>\\n</div>\\n<div>Apple unveiled the <span>iPhone 15</span>, <span>iPhone 15 Plus</span>, <span>iPhone 15 Pro</span> and <span>iPhone 15 Pro Max</span> on September 12th, 2023.</div>\\n<div>The biggest upgrade for the vanilla <span>iPhone 15</span> and <span>iPhone 15 Plus</span> was a new 48-megapixel main camera sensor with 2X sensor crop, the first time the vanilla iPhones have some higher quality zoom option. Other new features are the A16 Bionic chip, the Dynamic Island, a screen that matches the Pro series in brightness, as well as the new USB-C port. However, you still don\\'t have ProMotion on these two iPhones, and they also lack a physical zoom lens.</div>\\n<div>The 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max received a bigger list of upgrades. They are both built using a new and more durable titanium frame, and both models weigh significantly less than before. You also get a new 5X zoom camera, but only on the Pro Max, while the smaller Pro version sticks with a 3X zoom one. The camera updates don\\'t end there: you also get new 1.2X and 1.5X sensor crop options, and those are both very popular zoom lengths that will get a lot of use.</div>\\n<div>Other new features include the new A17 Pro chipset, a screen with much slimmer bezels and the USB-C port which on the Pro models supports faster USB 3 transfer speeds. The usual ProRAW and ProRES recording options are also here.</div>\\n<div>Oh, and you have a new Action button only on the Pro models which you can set to anything you like via the Shortcuts app.</div>\\n<h2><span>iPhone SE 4th Gen (2024)</span></h2>\\n<div>First half of 2024</div>\\n<div>Apple is expected to unveil its next generation <a>iPhone SE (the 4th gen)</a> in the first half of 2024.</div>\\n<div>Currently, the <span>iPhone SE</span> is on a 2-year update cycle, and that\\'s why expect to see bigger than usual upgrades this year.</div>\\n<div>The rumor mill says the <span>iPhone SE</span> will make the jump from the old touch button to the new gesture navigation and more modern iPhone design style.

It\\'s priced at $40 and launches today.</li>\\n<li>It\\'s a sleek tracker that\\'s only the width of two credit cards, and the battery lasts for five months.</li>\\n<li>However, be aware that it requires a wireless charger.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If you\\'re like me, and you still carry around a physical wallet with your cards, cash, and IDs, chances are you\\'re pretty careful about ensuring you don\\'t lose it. Of course, that\\'s easier said than done, especially if you already have a habit of misplacing things like your phone and need to fire up an app to locate where you left it.</p>\\n<p><strong>Also:</strong><a><strong>The best AirTag wallets you can buy: Expert recommended</strong></a></p>\\n<p>Fortunately, if you\\'re a forgetful person or simply someone who always wants to know where their wallet is, Nomad has the solution: a\\xa0<span><a><span>Tracking Card</span></a></span>. Available starting today for $40, the card is Nomad\\'s take on an AirTag for your wallet.\\xa0  </p>\\n<a><span>View at Nomad Goods</span></a><p>Most companies have developed what are effectively holsters for AirTags that, when attached to your wallet, let you know where your wallet is at all times through the Find My app. That approach, however, is clumsy and bulky; the tag noticeably  protrudes from your wallet, and you often need to buy a new wallet anyway as the holsters are built into the wallet itself -- not as a simple attachment.</p>\\n<p>With the Tracking Card, all you need is room in your current wallet for a card that\\'s about the width of two credit cards stacked on top of each other. I slotted mine in the back of the <a>Card Wallet Plus</a>\\xa0that Nomad sent me a while ago, and it fit like a charm.</p>\\n<figure> <figcaption> <span>Max Buondonno/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>When you take the card out of its packaging, you\\'re prompted to press and hold a button. This triggers the setup process and lets you pair it with your Apple account. From there, you simply open the Find My app on your iPhone and add a new device. The card will pop up as \"Nomad Card\" on the lower half of your screen. Tap the Connect button, give your card a name and an emoji, and you\\'ll be good to go.</p>\\n<p><strong>Also: <a>How to find out if an AirTag is tracking you</a></strong></p>\\n<p>You can easily find your card through the Find My app, just like you would with any AirTag or third-party accessory that works with Find My. You can even ring the device to locate your wallet, although the ring itself isn\\'t very loud.</p>\\n<figure> <figcaption> <span>Max Buondonno/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the best features of the Tracking Card is the battery. Nomad included a rechargeable battery that lasts up to five months on a single charge. When it\\'s time to recharge, you drop it on any Qi or MagSafe wireless charger and a green light will appear when it\\'s full. This means you won\\'t need to worry about replacing the battery or plugging it in with your phone charger to juice back up.</p>\\n<p>Nomad even points out that you can use a standing MagSafe charger to recharge the Tracking Card; while there are no magnets in the card itself (which… thank God, because your credit cards would be destroyed), there\\'s enough metal that allows the card to hang onto the charger. I tried it myself, and it worked like a charm.</p>\\n<p>The card looks boring from a distance, but if you come close, you\\'ll see its internals outlined to add a bit of character.

They did, however, bring us the iconic and much-imitated iPhone, which debuted June 29, 2007.</p>\\n<h2> <span>Precursors to the iPhone</span> </h2>\\n<p>Prior to the iPhone, smartphones were often, bulky, unreliable, and prohibitively expensive. The iPhone was a game-changer. While its technology was state-of-the-art at the time, since more than 200\\xa0<a>patents</a>\\xa0went into its original manufacture, there\\'s no pinpointing a single person as the iPhone\\'s inventor. Still, a few names—including Apple designers John Casey and Jonathan Ive—stand out as being instrumental in bringing Steve Jobs\\' vision for a touchscreen smartphone to life.</p>\\n<p>While Apple had produced the Newton MessagePad, a personal digital assistant (PDA) device, from 1993 to 1998, the first\\xa0concept for a true iPhone-type device came about in 2000 when Apple designer John Casey sent some concept art around via an internal email for something he called the Telipod—a telephone and iPod combination.\\xa0The\\xa0Telipod\\xa0never made it into production but Apple co-founder and CEO <a>Steve Jobs</a> did believe that cell phones with a <a>touchscreen</a> function and access to the Internet were the future of accessible information. Accordingly, Jobs set a team of engineers to tackle the project.</p>\\n<h2> <span>Apple\\'s First Smartphone</span> </h2>\\n<div><a><div>\\n<div>Read More</div>\\n<div>The Brief History of Smartphones</div>\\n<div>By Tuan C. Nguyen</div>\\n</div></a></div>\\n<p>Apple\\'s first smartphone, the ROKR E1, was released on Sept. 7, 2005. It was the first mobile phone to use iTunes, the music-sharing software Apple had debuted in 2001. However, the ROKR was an Apple and Motorola collaboration, and Apple was not happy with Motorola\\'s contributions. Within a year, Apple discontinued support for the ROKR. On Jan. 9, 2007, Steve Jobs announced the new iPhone at the Macworld Convention. It went on sale on June 29, 2007.</p>\\n<h2> <span>What Made the iPhone So Special</span> </h2>\\n<p>Apple\\'s chief design officer from 1992 to 2019, Jonathan Ive, was largely responsible for the look and feel of the iPhone. Born in Britain in February 1967, Ive was also the principal designer of the iMac, the titanium and aluminum PowerBook G4, MacBook, unibody MacBook Pro, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.</p>\\n<p>The first smartphone with no dedicated keypad for dialing, the iPhone was entirely a touchscreen device that broke new technological ground with its multitouch controls. In addition to being able to use the screen to select and use apps, users could scroll and zoom as well with a finger swipe.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone also introduced the accelerometer, a motion sensor that allowed the user to turn the phone sideways and have the display automatically rotate to suit. While it was not the first device to have apps or software add-ons, it was the first smartphone to manage the apps market successfully.</p>\\n<h2> <span>Siri</span> </h2>\\n<p>The iPhone 4S was released with the addition of a personal assistant called Siri, a voice-controlled, artificial intelligence-based assistant that could not only perform numerous tasks for the user, it could also learn and adapt to better serve that user, as well. With the addition of Siri, the iPhone was no longer a mere phone or music player—it literally put an entire world of information at the user\\'s fingertips.</p>\\n<h2> <span>Waves of the Future</span> </h2>\\n<p>Since it made its debut, Apple has continued to improve and update the iPhone. The iPhone 10 (also known as iPhone X), released in November 2017, is the first iPhone to use\\xa0organic light-emitting diode\\xa0(OLED)\\xa0screen technology, wireless charging, and facial recognition technology to unlock the phone.</p>\\n<p>In 2018, Apple released three versions of the iPhone X: iPhone Xs, iPhone X Max (a larger version of the Xs), and the budget-friendly iPhone Xr, all with improved camera technology that enables what Apple terms, \"Smart HDR\" (high dynamic range) photography. Going forward, Apple is expected to continue with OLED displays for its 2019 devices, and there are some rumors that the company plans to soon retire its earlier LCD (liquid crystal display) displays altogether.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div><div><div>\\n<button><span>Cite this Article</span></button><div>\\n<div>Format</div>\\n<a>mla</a><a>apa</a><a>chicago</a><div>Your Citation</div>\\n<div>\\n<span>Bellis, Mary. \"Who Invented the iPhone?\" ThoughtCo, Feb. 16, 2021, thoughtco.com/who-invented-the-iphone-1992004.</span><span>Bellis, Mary.

It had gone from a tablet to a phone. From a dream to reality. And just before he stepped out in front of the crowd, Jobs assembled his team and told them to remember the moment: The moment before iPhone. Because, in the next moment, everything would change.</p>\\n<p>Watch the video above. Seriously. It\\'s way better.</p>\\n<p>During the keynote, Steve Jobs said it was rare enough for a company to revolutionize even one product category. Apple had already revolutionized two: Computers with the Mac and personal music players with the iPod. With the iPhone they\\'d be going for three.</p>\\n<p>He set up and knocked down the physical keyboard and the stylus, features that dominated the BlackBerry, Motorola, and Palm smartphones of the day. Then Jobs introduced the multitouch interface that let the iPhone smoothly pinch-to-zoom, the physics-based interactivity that included inertial scrolling and rubberbanding, and the multitasking that let him move seamlessly from music to call to web to email and back.</p>\\n<p>They were technologies that would one day become commonplace across the industry but back then looked like science-fiction. From <a>Apple</a>:</p>\\n<figure><blockquote><p>iPhone is a revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone. We are all born with the ultimate pointing device—our fingers—and iPhone uses them to create the most revolutionary user interface since the mouse.</p></blockquote></figure><h2>Technology alone wasn\\'t enough</h2>\\n<p>The original iPhone, based on the P2 device of the Project Experience Purple (PEP) team, code-named M68 and device number iPhone1,1, had a 3.5-inch LCD screen at 320x480 and 163ppi, a quad-band 2G EDGE data radio, 802.11b.g Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 2.0 EDR, and a 2-megapixel camera.</p>\\n<div><div><div>\\n<section><h2>Master your iPhone in minutes</h2></section><section><p>iMore offers spot-on advice and guidance from our team of experts, with decades of Apple device experience to lean on.

Two NAND Flash-based storage tiers were available at launch: 4GB or 8GB.</p>\\n<p>More importantly, iPhone also included several sensors to enhance the experience, like an accelerometer that could automatically rotate the screen to match device orientation, a proximity sensor that could automatically turn off the screen when close to the face, and an ambient light sensor that could automatically adjust brightness.</p>\\n<p>And it could also be charged—and critically, synced to iTunes—by the same 30-pin Dock connector as Apple\\'s already exceedingly popular iPod.</p>\\n<div><div><div>Image 1 of 4</div></div></div>\\n<p>What the original iPhone didn\\'t have was CDMA and EVDO rev A network compatibility. That meant it couldn\\'t work on two of the U.S.\\' big four carriers, Verizon and Sprint. Not that it mattered; the original iPhone was exclusive to AT&amp;T.</p>\\n<p>It also lacked GPS, or support for faster 3G UTMS/HSPA data speeds. In addition to no hardware keyboard or stylus, the iPhone also didn\\'t have a removable, user-replaceable battery or SD card support. None of that pleased existing power users of the time. Nor did the absence of an exposed file system, copy and paste or any form of advanced text editing, and, critically to many, support for third-party apps. Likewise, since the iPhone had a real web browser instead of a WAP browser, which was required to display carrier-based multimedia messages, the original iPhone didn\\'t support MMS either.</p>\\n<p>All of this was wrapped in bead-blasted aluminum with a black plastic band around the back to allow for RF transparency.</p>\\n<p>Then there was the price. The iPhone debuted at $499 for the 4GB and $599 for the 8GB model <em>on-contract</em>. Those prices weren\\'t unheard of at the time—early Motorola RAZR flip phones were incredibly expensive as well—but it meant Apple couldn\\'t penetrate the mainstream market.</p>\\n<h2>Race to launch</h2>\\n<p>Macworld wasn\\'t a finish line, it was a shot from the starting pistol. Jony Ive, Richard Howarth, and the industrial design teams\\' work had largely been completed already but hardware engineering still faced challenges.</p>\\n<p>Steve Jobs scratched the pre-release iPhone screen with the keys in his pocket, he asked the team to come up with a better solution. They turned to Corning, which had invented a new, chemically hardened material, but had yet to find a commercial application for it. The team spun on a dime and got Gorilla Glass onto the iPhone.</p>\\n<p>The software team, under the auspices of Scott Forstall, was still racing as well. Greg Christie, Bas Ording, Mike Matas and others had been working on the human interface and interactivity for a long time already, but things were still being tweaked. Split screen for email, for example, got pulled after Jobs felt it was too crowded on the small screen.</p>\\n<p>Likewise Henri Lamiraux\\'s software engineering and frameworks team, including Nitin Ganatra\\'s native apps team, and Richard\\' Williamson\\'s mobile web team. They had to make sure all the apps and all the features performed not only reliably but delightfully.</p>\\n<p>They\\'d already gotten a relatively full version of Safari, based on the same WebKit rendering engine developed by Don Melton and team for the Mac, up and running. They\\'d also taken Google\\'s location data and created the best Maps implementation ever seen on mobile, but they were then tasked with adding a YouTube app as well.</p>\\n<p>On June 6, 2007 Steve Jobs again took to the stage at Moscone West, this time for Apple\\'s Worldwide Developer Conference. He announced web 2.0 apps as the development platform but also announced something more: the launch date.</p>\\n<h2>Go for launch</h2>\\n<p>On June 28, 2007, Apple shipped the original iPhone. Lineups had already formed at Apple Stores, especially flagship stores like the glass cube in New York City. People had been waiting outside for days. The lines went around the block. And then around again. Anticipation was stratospheric. Competitors were dismissing it. Media was calling it the Jesus Phone.</p>\\n<p>And then the doors opened.</p>\\n<p>The initial reaction was positive. Walt Mossberg and Katherine Boehret, writing for <a>The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>\\n<figure><blockquote><p>Our verdict is that, despite some flaws and feature omissions, the iPhone is, on balance, a beautiful and breakthrough handheld computer. Its software, especially, sets a new bar for the smart-phone industry, and its clever finger-touch interface, which dispenses with a stylus and most buttons, works well, though it sometimes adds steps to common functions.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Ryan Block, writing for <a>Engadget</a>:</p>\\n<figure><blockquote><p>It\\'s easy to see the device is extraordinarily simple to use for such a full-featured phone and media player. Apple makes creating the spartan, simplified UI look oh so easy -- but we know it\\'s not, and the devil\\'s always in the details when it comes to portables. To date no one\\'s made a phone that does so much with so little, and despite the numerous foibles of the iPhone\\'s gesture-based touchscreen interface, the learning curve is surprisingly low. It\\'s totally clear that with the iPhone, Apple raised the bar not only for the cellphone, but for portable media players and multifunction convergence devices in general.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The novelty and experience were so good, many people simply didn\\'t care about missing features or high price tags. But the price did prevent iPhone from getting into as many hands and lives as Apple wanted.</p>\\n<p>So, at the September 5, 2007 \"The Beat Goes On\" music event, Steve Jobs not only introduced the first iPod touch, he announced they were dropping the 4GB iPhone entirely, and dropping the price of the 8GB iPhone to $399. From <a>Apple</a>:</p>\\n<figure><blockquote><p>The surveys are in and iPhone customer satisfaction scores are higher than we\\'ve ever seen for any Apple product. We\\'ve clearly got a breakthrough product and we want to make it affordable for even more customers as we enter this holiday season.</p></blockquote></figure><p>On February 5, 2008, Greg Joswiack, then vice president of Worldwide iPod and iPhone Product Marketing, now in charge of all product marketing, announced a 16GB model. From <a>Apple</a>:</p>\\n<figure><blockquote><p>For some users, there\\'s never enough memory. Now people can enjoy even more of their music, photos and videos on the most revolutionary mobile phone and best Wi-Fi mobile device in the world.</p></blockquote></figure><p>There was still no subsidized price, even on contract, but there was movement.</p>\\n<h2>Competitive contempt</h2>\\n<p>The vast majority of smartphones back in 2007 had hardware keyboards and, if they touch screens at all, those screens were almost all resistive and came with a stylus pen to aid in usability. Mobile apps were inconsistent and the mobile web was pretty much limited to WAP browsers.</p>\\n<p>While the iPhone certainly wasn\\'t universally adored, the entrenched incumbents in the smartphone space were some of its harshest critics. That was, after all, their jobs.</p>\\n<p>Ed Coligan, former CEO of Palm:</p>\\n<figure><blockquote><p>We\\'ve learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make a decent phone. PC guys are not going to just figure this out. They\\'re not going to just walk in.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Mike Lazaridis, former CEO of RIM (now BlackBerry):</p>\\n<figure><blockquote><p>Talk -- all I\\'m [hearing] is talk about [the iPhone\\'s chances in Enterprise]. I think it\\'s important that we put this thing in perspective. [...] Apple\\'s design-centric approach [will] ultimately limit its appeal by sacrificing needed enterprise functionality. I think over-focus on one blinds you to the value of the other. [...] Apple\\'s approach produced devices that inevitably sacrificed advanced features for aesthetics.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft:</p>\\n<figure><blockquote><p>You can get a Motorola Q for $99. [...] [Apple] will have the most expensive phone, by far, in the marketplace. There\\'s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.</p></blockquote></figure><p>It was a very different world in 2007. Phone were just beginning to hit usable data speeds but bandwidth was still limited and expensive. The appeal of smartphones was also limited primarily to early adopters and enterprise, and hadn\\'t yet approached mainstream adoption.</p>\\n<p>Palm and BlackBerry were both wrong. Smartphones would give way to pocket computers and \"PC guys\"—if they worked for Apple—were absolutely the ones to figure it out. And for consumers, the interface is the feature, so by tackling interface Apple was beginning to make those pocket computers accessible to everyone.</p>\\n<p>Microsoft, however, was at least half right. The iPhone was too expensive. That was something Apple could and would change.</p>\\n<p>Google, an original iPhone launch partner, was both more perceptive, and more agile. They\\'d already bought Danger, the next generation phone platform created by Sidekick mastermind — and former Apple employee — Andy Rubin. They\\'d originally focused on making a Windows Mobile/BlackBerry-style competitor, determined to make sure Microsoft could never dominate the market and cut them out of the mobile future they so clearly recognized would be the next big thing.</p>\\n<p>Google\\'s then-CEO, Eric Schmidt was on Apple\\'s Board of Director\\'s—and on stage for the iPhone event. He hadn\\'t told Rubin what Apple was doing, however, or that Google would be giving the iPhone Maps and YouTube. Rubin was shocked. Collectively they realized Microsoft might not dominate mobile at all. Apple might. So, much to their credit, they spun around and refocused Android at the iPhone.</p>\\n<h2>Changing everything... again</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>stack of old iphones</span><span>(Image credit: iMore)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The original iPhone ended up selling over 6 million units in its first year on four carriers in four countries. Now, iPhone sells hundreds of millions a year on almost every carrier in almost every country. It\\'s also been followed up by iPad, Apple TV and Apple Watch, HomeKit and HeathKit, CarPlay and AirPlay, AirPods and, soon, HomePod. And, with <a>iPhone X</a>, we\\'ve seen the beginning of what\\'s next.</p>\\n<p>Steve Jobs told his team the world would never be the same.

It remains the cheapest new iPhone in Apple\\'s line-up, but the new iPhone SE is actually more expensive than its predecessor.</p>\\n<p>But affordability was never the main selling point of Apple\\'s entry-level iPhone: it was all about the portability.</p>\\n<p>So when Apple introduced the very first iPhone SE back in 2016, it was all about the size.

Released in 2012, the iPhone 5 was pretty impressive at the time with its newer, slimmer body, its 4-inch Retina display and its snazzy new Lightning connector, which replaced the previous 30-pin Dock connector.\\xa0</p>\\n<div><div><div>\\n<section><h2>Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox</h2></section><section><p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p>\\n<form>\\n<label>Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands</label><label>Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</label>\\n</form>\\n<footer>By submitting your information you agree to the <a>Terms &amp; Conditions</a> and <a>Privacy Policy</a> and are aged 16 or over.</footer></section>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<p>The iPhone 5 was one of the shortest-lived iPhones, replaced in 2013 by the <a>iPhone 5S</a> and the <a>iPhone 5C</a>, and it was much missed: when the next iPhone, the <a>iPhone 6</a>, got significantly bigger it was clear that for many people the smaller iPhone was the sweet spot in terms of portability and usability.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone SE was launched in March 2016 to make those people happy, and while it looked like the iPhone 5 it didn\\'t have the same innards.</p>\\n<p>Instead of an Apple A6 chip it had the same A9 as the 2015 <a>iPhone 6S</a>, and it also had a 12MP rear camera, Live Photos and Retina Flash. It was something of a stealth iPhone, with modern internals in an older case, and it was much-mourned when Apple canned it in late 2018.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>It has the distinction, along with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, of having the longest iOS support of any iPhone: seven versions, starting with <a>iOS 9</a> and running all the way up to <a>iOS 15</a>.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone SE 2020</h2>\\n<figure><figcaption><span>(Image credit: TechRadar / Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The second generation iPhone SE</strong></p>\\n<p>Apple decided to bring back the iPhone SE in early 2020. This time it was part of the same iPhone generation as the <a>iPhone 11</a>, and Apple launched the <a>iPhone SE 2020</a> at the same time as it discontinued the iPhone 8/8 Plus in April 2020.</p>\\n<p>Like the first generation, the second iPhone SE was a mix of older design and modern insides. It was based on the iPhone 8, but inside it was an iPhone 11: it had the A13 Bionic system-on-a-chip and a 4.7-inch Retina display.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s small compared to other phones, but it was a significant improvement over its predecessor\\'s 4-inch display, and it has True Tone, Display P3 and <a>HDR</a>10/Dolby Vision support (although it can\\'t actually display HDR; instead it enhances the content for its own display).\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Camera-wise the second iPhone SE was very similar to the iPhone 8, with its 12MP rear camera capable of <a>4K</a> video, 63MP panoramas and Smart HDR.

The previous iPhone SE was 4G-only, and that means it was lagging behind much of the rest of the affordable smartphone market.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>5G is faster and more reliable than 4G, but unfortunately faster connections also mean a higher price tag: the iPhone SE 2022 is $30 / £30 / AU$40 more expensive than its predecessor.To be fair, there are a lot of other improvements too. There\\'s \"the toughest glass in any smartphone\" to protect it from lumps and bumps, and it has the same six-core CPU / 4-core GPU A15 Bionic system-on-a-chip as the iPhone 13.</p>\\n<p>That delivers better battery life, and it also enables the iPhone SE to have the same secure on-device Siri and dictation as the iPhone 13, something that wasn\\'t possible in the previous SE model.If you like to take photos you\\'ll love the improved camera setup in the new iPhone SE, which can do the same computational photography as the iPhone 13. That means the ability to save your own photographic styles for faster processing, smart HDR 4 for exceptional contrast and detail and faster Portrait processing too.</p>\\n<p>It also means you get the brilliant Live Text processing that can recognize text when you point your camera at it or open an image containing text.If you like the sound of that, pre-orders start this Friday and the iPhone SE 5G goes on sale on March 18.</p>\\n<ul><li>Everything you need to know about the <a>iPhone SE 2022</a>\\n</li></ul>\\n<h2>iPhone SE 4?</h2>\\n<p><strong>Will there be a fourth generation iPhone SE?</strong></p>\\n<p>Only time will tell, and it may be determined by how well the new iPhone SE 2022 is received.

That’s only 15 years ago. Since then, Apple has been working hard to improve and polish its smartphone experience. It’s always good to appreciate the products we love and their excellent features, so here’s a dive into the history of the iPhone, its evolution, and the changes the line-up has gone through since its inception.</p></div>\\n<div><h2>Life before the iPhone</h2></div>\\n<div><div><div><div>Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority</div></div></div></div>\\n<div><p>Those of us that lived through the early days of mobile remember a time when phones were much more basic than today. Most devices made calls and sent text messages, but couldn’t do much more. Some phones had a few extras like Snake, a calculator, or a calendar. The fancy ones maybe had phones with radio access, or even the ability to play MP3 songs. Things started changing during the turn of the century, though.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The first BlackBerry came to be in 1999. Similarly, <a>T-Mobile’s</a> first Sidekick phone was launched in 2002. Microsoft entered the picture in 2003 with Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Phone Edition (long name, right?). Palm, Nokia, Samsung, and Motorola also tried to put together their smartphones.</p></div>\\n<div><p>These phones could make calls and texts, too, but they started to venture into the world of the almighty internet. Suddenly, you could send emails, instant messages, manage calendars, and even navigate the internet through a basic browser. Some of these phones even came with cameras! Something was brewing in the industry, and we didn’t know exactly how it would all evolve.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Touchscreens weren’t really a thing then. Though the odd device had it, it wasn’t nearly as functional as what the iPhone brought to the table. Most touchscreens in the past were resistive, which required pressure instead of reacting to an electrical conductor (such as your finger). These were more so made to work with styluses. Steve Jobs saw this early on and believed that phones would eventually replace things like cameras, MP3 players, PDAs, etc. He started believing that phones with a touchscreen and internet access were the future, so the idea behind the iPhone sparked.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone’s capacitive screen had no need for accessories. All you had to do was tap and swipe more naturally. It also allowed for natural finger scrolling and pinch-to-zoom.</p></div>\\n<div><p>It seems the beginnings of the iPhone were a bit rocky, though. Tony Fadell once told <a>Venture Beat</a> the first iPhone concept was actually an iPod with a phone module. It’s said Steve Jobs was first focused on making a great phone that could fit comfortably in the palm of your hand. He wanted it to be great at making calls, and believed most smartphones at the time focused too much on intelligent functions and made it too hard to make a simple call. This is true, as most of these had physical keyboards. For example, making a call on a Blackberry required going around crowded keys and using function buttons just to type in numbers.</p></div>\\n<div><p>It was a flop, of course. Steve Jobs killed the project and started from scratch. Jobs assembled a small team of experts to begin working on what would later become the iPhone. They called it “Project Purple,” and the team practically lived at the company’s headquarters. This team was playing with multiple new technologies. There were talks of a touch-enabled Mac, and they were messing with a multi-touch ping pong table, which Steve wanted to put “in an iPod.” At the same time, they were trying to make video watching more enjoyable on iPods, which is why they wanted to add a larger screen and remove the touch scroll wheel.</p></div>\\n<div><p>After long hours, weekends, and hard work, the first iPhone came to be in 2007.</p></div>\\n<div><h2>iPhone — iPhone 3GS: The start of a new era</h2></div>\\n<div><p>Apple didn’t exactly invent the idea of the smartphone, but they were the first to truly popularize the concept outside of certain business and “techie” niches. Previous smartphones were clunky, had complex user interfaces that were hard to operate, and pretty much all of them had physical keyboards, which sacrificed screen real estate. There was virtually nothing like the iPhone before it. The first iPhone was announced on January 9, 2007, and was extraordinary.</p></div>\\n<div><p>As Steve Jobs put it then, the iPhone was “an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator.” It was the first to have such a high screen-to-body ratio, offering a 3.5-inch screen with a capacitive touchscreen. This made it possible to control every aspect of the device using your fingers, and it even provided multi-touch support.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The accelerometer and motion sensor made it easy to have the screen orientation change when the phone was turned sideways. This made the first iPhone a fantastic content consumption device. You could enjoy videos and other content on a wide screen.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The UI was simple, showing a list of icons for each app, and third-party developers could make apps for all iPhone users. The interface was so good that even today’s iPhones largely use the same UI, just with obvious aesthetic and feature improvements over the years.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone was here to stay, and we can confidently say it shaped the future of smartphone technology and set a standard for other manufacturers to work upon.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Apple had to work out a few kinks, though. Steve Jobs was obsessed with keeping the experience clean and simple. He didn’t entirely trust developers yet, so the first iPhone came with no app store. You could only use the apps Apple offered. The Apple App Store was introduced later, in 2008, with the iPhone 3G. The newer device was otherwise very similar. The other main improvement was the addition of 3G data speeds. There were also slight design changes, including thinner bezels.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone 3GS later refined the experience in 2009 by adding more power to the device. The internals were beefed up with a better processor, more RAM, a better 3.15MP camera, and the addition of a white color variant.</p></div>\\n<div><h2>iPhone 4 — iPhone 4S: Refining the design, the introduction of Siri, and Retina Displays</h2></div>\\n<div><p>The 2010 iPhone 4 got the first significant design change. The sides, back, and front were flattened, and the back was made of glass, offering a more modern and streamlined look. Specs were also significantly better. A 1.0GHz Cortex-A8 processor powered the device, and RAM was again doubled to 512MB. The camera sensor got a boost to 5MP, and users could record at 720p! Not only that, but this was the first iPhone to come with a front-facing camera (VGA).</p></div>\\n<div><p>Additionally, this was the first phone with a Retina Display. This quadrupled the pixels in the iPhone 3GS screen, bringing the definition to 640 x 960. Apple claimed your eyes could no longer notice pixels at this 330ppi pixel density. Apple stuck with around the same pixel density until the iPhone X, long after Android phones had moved on to bigger and higher resolution displays.</p></div>\\n<div><p>These were all significant improvements, but something else was brewing at Apple’s HQ. The iPhone 4S showed up in 2011 and, among performance improvements, introduced <a>Siri</a>. Apple’s digital assistant was released years before <a>Alexa</a> in 2014, and far earlier than <a>Google Assistant</a> in 2016. It was a game-changer at the time, but it really wasn’t as refined as current digital assistants. You had to be very specific about your requests and there weren’t nearly as many commands as you can access today. Siri could work with your calendar, texts, calls, weather, reminders, and a few other apps. The most human thing it could do <a>was probably tell jokes.</a> These days, you can almost have a conversation with digital assistants, still it was a good start.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Interestingly, this phone series also sparked the legal battle between Apple and Samsung. <a>Apple won</a>, and everything stopped in 2018.</p></div>\\n<div><h2>iPhone 5 — iPhone 5S: Larger screen, Lightning port, and Touch ID</h2></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone 5 series came with some more significant changes in 2012. The device’s looks were pretty different, as it now came with an aluminum back. The new iPhone series had more than fresh looks going for it, though.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The phone’s shape was taller because the phone now came with a larger 4-inch display that only grew vertically (640 x 1136). This was because Apple loved its devices’ width, which was great for one-handed use. The company wanted to keep the phone as wide as previous versions, but the market for larger-screen phones was all the rage. Everyone wanted a larger screen on an iPhone, and it finally came.</p></div>\\n<div><p>This was also the first phone to get rid of the old 30-pin connecter. The more clunky port was easier to damage and was a bit on the large side, at least compared to the standard back then, which was MicroUSB. Of course Apple still stuck to its own proprietary cable,<a>using lightning cables.</a></p></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone 5S was released a year later in 2013 and offered a game-changing feature. It was the first iPhone to come with <a>Touch ID</a>, a fingerprint reader located in the home button.</p></div>\\n<div>\\n<p>Interestingly enough, during this era, we saw the first “affordable” iPhone come to market. It wasn’t much cheaper and only cost $100 less than the iPhone 5, but the iPhone 5C offered a fun alternative to the more expensive premium handsets, and it was available in a bevy of fun colors. However, Apple had to cut some corners, so the phone had a more basic plastic design.</p>\\n<p><strong>The competition:</strong> <a>The history of the Android operating system</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<div><h2>iPhone 6 series — iPhone 7 series: Plus models, large screens, Apple Pay, IP rating, multiple cameras, goodbye headphone jack</h2></div>\\n<div><p>Remember the whole thing about keeping iPhones small and easy to handle? That philosophy went out the window with the iPhone 6 series. This time Apple released two devices: the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The base version came with a 4.7-inch display, while the Plus model had a whopping 5.5-inch screen (huge at the time). iPhones finally offered large screens like you’d find <a>on Android</a>, which people loved (and still do).</p></div>\\n<div><p>The design was changed to a less flat one. Of course not everything was perfect. Do you remember “bend gate”? iPhone 6 devices were bending left and right, quickly becoming a marketing disaster. But hey, at least we got <a>Apple Pay</a>! Mobile payments were well on their way since 2011, when Google first introduced <a>Google Wallet</a>. This means Apple was a bit late to the party, but they sure knew how to make an entrance. The company had support for cards within the most popular networks: American Express, MasterCard, and Visa. Apple Pay also launched with support for over 220,000 merchants across the USA. We can say Apple proliferated the use of contactless payments. These were more of a cool trick or conversation starter when we used Google Wallet.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The 2015 iPhone 6S series was more of an incremental upgrade with slight hardware improvements. Similarly, the iPhone 7 series didn’t bring any noticeable changes in 2016, but it was the first iPhone to get an official IP rating. More specifically, the iPhone 7 series featured an IP67 rating.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Camera enthusiasts were thrilled to learn the iPhone 7 Plus was the first iPhone to get more than one rear camera. It had two 12MP sensors, one with a wide lens and another with a telephoto lens.</p></div>\\n<div><p>On the other hand, audiophiles remember the iPhone 7 series devices as the first to dump the headphone jack. Dongles have been your only solution for wired listening since then.</p></div>\\n<div><h2>iPhone SE — Apple’s first true budget phone</h2></div>\\n<div>\\n<p>Apple never really made affordable phones. The iPhone 5C was a bit cheaper, but nothing game-changing. Things changed with the first <a>iPhone SE (2016)</a>, which came with an impressive $249 MSRP. The design was reverted back to something more similar to the older iPhone 5 than more modern iPhones. The screen also shrunk down to just 4 inches. The good news was that specs were still nearly as good as higher-end iPhones. It had the same Apple A9 processor found in the iPhone 6S series, 2GB of RAM, and a 12MP camera. This was the beginning of a new trend, and iPhones were no longer only for the premium market.</p>\\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a>The best cheap phones you can buy today</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<div><h2>iPhone 8 series — Wireless charging enters the game</h2></div>\\n<div><p>The 2017 <a>iPhone 8 and 8 Plus</a> were the first iPhones with wireless charging. Again, Apple was a bit late to the party, as we started seeing Qi wireless charging in smartphones as soon as 2012. The Nokia Lumia 920 was the first widely available smartphone to feature it. The <a>Samsung Galaxy S3</a> could also take advantage of wireless charging with an added accessory.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Design-wise, the phones returned to the glass backs we saw in previous iPhones. Another significant upgrade was the addition of True Tone technology, a method that utilized sensors to measure ambient light and adjust the screen to its surroundings.</p></div>\\n<div><p>While a bit underwhelming, the iPhone 8 series was the proliferation of the old iPhone. A new era was about to begin, and the changes started the same year.</p></div>\\n<div><h2>iPhone X, XR, and XS — All-screen front, Face ID, IP68</h2></div>\\n<div><p>Apple released an extra phone along with the iPhone 8 series. The iPhone X was a celebration of the iPhone line-up’s tenth anniversary, and it brought forth some major advancements that were impressive at the time. For starters, you’ll notice there was no longer a home button, and the front was nearly all screen. The large top and bottom bezels were gone, and Apple finally entered the all-screen front game. The dreaded bezel was (and still is) there, but at least they were moving forward.</p></div>\\n<div><p>It’s also unique because it’s the first phone to use Face ID as a biometric method. Sadly, this was a replacement not just a nice extra. Because there is no longer a button/fingerprint reader, Touch ID was gone (and still is on most modern iPhones). Additionally, the 5.8-inch screen was improved with an OLED panel and a 1,125 x 2,436 resolution.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Other aspects of the phone stayed very similar to the previous iPhones. The glass back and the rounded metal edges were still around.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Apple later (in 2018) released the <a>iPhone XR</a>, a more affordable version of the iPhone X. It switched the frame material to aluminum (as opposed to stainless steel), removed the OLED panel and replaced it with an LCD one, and left only a single camera in the back. The device was still plenty powerful, though. The processor was upgraded to an Apple A12 Bionic, it keeps the same 3GB of RAM, and the display is larger at 6.1 inches.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The better <a>iPhone XS</a> series came out in 2018. Aside from a larger 6.5-inch display in the Max version, and more RAM, it was the first phone to feature an IP68 rating, which is still the standard for the best ingress protection available on smartphones.</p></div>\\n<div><h2>iPhone 11 series — iPhone 13 series: Today’s iPhones</h2></div>\\n<div><div><div><div>Eric Zeman / Android Authority</div></div></div></div>\\n<div><p>Apple has backpedaled before, and it turns out it likes the older designs better. The iPhone 11 takes its looks back to something more similar to the iPhone 5, with flat sides and squared-off edges. The main difference is that the iPhone 11 also keeps the mostly all-screen front we saw on the iPhone X devices. Interestingly, Apple has kept this design language for the iPhone 12 and 13 series. All these iPhones look nearly identical, with minor design changes across the board.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone 11 line-up was also the first to offer three devices: <a>iPhone 11</a>, iPhone 11 Pro, and <a>iPhone 11 Pro Max</a>. The Pro versions were also the first to have a triple-camera system.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The <a>iPhone 12 series</a> was the first to introduce a <a>Mini version</a>, which was a relief for small phone fans. All other high-end phones were enormous. These were also the first iPhones to get 5G data speeds, which was a welcomed improvement.</p></div>\\n<div>\\n<p>As for the <a>iPhone 13 series</a>, all phones look almost identical to the iPhone 12 variants. Improvements were only incremental, showing better specs across the board. We expect things to get much more exciting with the upcoming iPhone 14 series.</p>\\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a>The best iPhone dongles and accessories</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<div><h2>iPhone SE — The second coming of the budget iPhone</h2></div>\\n<div><div><div><div>David Imel / Android Authority</div></div></div></div>\\n<div><p>Amid a pandemic and global economic distress, 2020 was all about premium budget phones. At $399, the <a>iPhone SE</a> was a huge success, especially considering how much performance the little phone packed. It offered the same Apple A13 Bionic found on the iPhone 11 series, as well as 3GB of RAM.</p></div>\\n<div><p>It only had a single 12MP camera, but it was a pretty good one. Not to mention the phone offered wireless charging, had an IP67 rating, and had a 4.7-inch screen. People were itching for a smaller iPhone again (hey some people <a>do like small phones!</a>). The design was the same as the iPhone 8’s, which was good news to those who liked the home button and Touch ID.</p></div>\\n<div><h2>iPhone SE — 2022</h2></div>\\n<div><div><div><div>Ryan Haines / Android Authority</div></div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The <a>iPhone SE</a> is back to take on 2022, and though it looks the same as the 2020 version, some critical changes are in place. For starters, the specs are slightly better. This one has an Apple A15 Bionic, 4GB of RAM, and a slightly larger 2,018mAh battery. The most significant change is the addition of 5G support. And because this is an iPhone SE, the price is still very accessible. We’re still sticking to the iPhone 8 look.</p></div>\\n<div>\\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\\n<p>Apple is pretty good at hiding most information it’s not ready to announce, but we’re sure the <a>iPhone 14 series is in the works</a>. Rumors suggest the notch might finally disappear in favor of cut-outs. Sadly, rumors say there might not be an iPhone 14 Mini this time around.

Revealed as a device that was capable of iPod, Phone, and Internet functionalities, the iPhone marked the large first step in the smartphone market we know today. Apple made a huge departure from traditional cell phones, choosing to eliminate the keyboard and offer a digital option within the screen. With its 3.5-inch display and 2 megapixel embedded camera, the iPhone is a fun device to look back on as it changed the world of technology forever.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 3G - July 11, 2008</h3>\\n<output><figure><figcaption>Image Credit: Cult of Mac</figcaption></figure></output><p>The second iPhone ever released was the iPhone 3G. This device brought 3G functionality to the iPhone, allowing for much faster speeds when utilizing cellular data. Additionally, this iPhone was the first to include the Apple App Store, which opened the door to developers creating applications for mobile phones.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 3GS - June 19, 2009</h3>\\n<p><a>iPhone 3GS</a> was the first iPhone to introduce a camera upgrade, with a new 3 megapixel camera on the back of the phone. This allowed for clearer pictures, further moving the smartphone into replacing traditional cameras. Additionally, new storage options were introduced to allow users to download more apps on the App Store. Performance overall was also claimed to be twice as fast as the iPhone 3G.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 4 - June 24, 2010</h3>\\n<p>FaceTime was the star of the <a>iPhone 4</a>, allowing for users to video call between devices from any given location. iPhone 4 featured a 5 megapixel camera, allowing for HD video capture for the first time. This camera also included an LED flash, which had not previously been available on the iPhone. Alongside these features, the iPhone 4 offered Apple\\'s first Retina display, which sharpened the display to make text much more readable. </p>\\n<h3>iPhone 4S - October 14, 2011</h3>\\n<p>Most notably, the <a>iPhone 4S is</a> best known for the debut of Siri. The virtual assistant has gone on to be a staple of the Apple ecosystem, and it all started here. The iPhone 4S also featured 1080p video capture, thanks to its 8 megapixel onboard camera. Other major software like iCloud, iMessage, and more made their debut here on the iPhone 4S. </p>\\n<h3>iPhone 5 - September 21, 2012</h3>\\n<p><a>iPhone 5</a> was the first iPhone to support LTE technology, which created opportunities for large tasks and content to be available on cellular data. Audio was also a major focus, with new microphones added for crystal clear audio across both calls and FaceTime. This device was also the first iPhone to feature the Lightning port, a large departure from the previous 30-pin adapter.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 5S - September 20, 2013</h3>\\n<p>The <a>iPhone 5S</a> marked the first appearance of Touch ID, a new technology that allowed you to unlock your iPhone by holding your finger against the home button. This became a staple in all future models up until the iPhone X. Alongside this feature, the iPhone 5S packed in the A7 processor and new camera technologies.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 5C - September 20, 2013</h3>\\n<p>The <a>iPhone 5C</a> was Apple\\'s first budget conscious iPhone. Released alongside the iPhone 5S, the 5C was made available in vibrant colors that caught the attention of anyone passing by. Internally, the device utilizing the same hardware as the iPhone 5 from 2012, so Apple was able to offer the 5C at a lower, more approachable price, making it one of the <a>cheapest iPhones</a>.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 6 - September 19, 2014</h3>\\n<p>The <a>iPhone 6</a> took a departure from the boxy design previously seen in the last three generations and offered a slimmed out device perfect for any pocket. Arguably, the biggest feature of the iPhone 6 was none other than Apple Pay, which was powered by NFC technology embedded inside the phone. This was also the first iPhone generation to introduce multiple models, with the iPhone 6 Plus offering a larger 5.5 inch screen.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 6S - September 25, 2015</h3>\\n<p>The flagship feature of the <a>iPhone 6S</a> was 3D Touch, a technology that allowed the screen of the device to measure and take in different amounts of pressure. This allowed for multiple commands depending on how firmly you pressed against the screen, which led to new gestures all around. Additionally, the iPhone 6S was the first iPhone to have 4K video capabilities, which paved the way for iPhone to be used for filming.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone SE - March 31, 2016</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone SE (Special Edition) brought back the body style of the iPhone 5S and packed it with new, updated features. Capabilities from the iPhone 6S such as 4K video were included on the SE, offering a quality and compact option at a lower price point. This marked the first iPhone SE, with two more generations produced in the years following 2016.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 7 - September 16, 2016</h3>\\n<p><a>iPhone 7</a> launched in Fall 2016 with a huge controversial twist - Apple decided to remove the headphone jack. This move shifted audio to either Bluetooth or through the Lightning port. This generation also added water resistance to the iPhone, in addition to a sturdy home button that utilized Apple\\'s Taptic Engine for haptic feedback. Lastly, the <a>iPhone 7 Plus</a> was the first iPhone to offer a dual camera system. </p>\\n<h3>iPhone 8 - September 22, 2017</h3>\\n<p><a>iPhone 8</a> was largely the same design as the iPhone 7, with a few solid improvements to help the device stand out. First, wireless charging was added with a glass panel placed on the back of the iPhone. For the first time, you did not need to charge the phone through the Lightning port. Further, the iPhone 8 was the first phone to introduce the True Tone display. This display changes the colors and brightness of your device depending on your environmental surroundings.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone X - November 3, 2017</h3>\\n<p>The <a>iPhone X</a> was a huge departure from prior models, serving as the company\\'s vision 10 years after the release of the original iPhone. The device made away with the home button, opting for a phone made entirely of just screen. New facial recognition technology called Face ID was revealed, which allowed users to unlock the iPhone X by directly looking at it. The iPhone X shaped all models that released after it, with each new iPhone utilizing a similar display and Face ID tech. </p>\\n<h3>iPhone XS - September 21, 2018</h3>\\n<p>The <a>iPhone XS</a> was a minimal improvement over the iPhone X, but there are some decent upgrades that future models benefitted from. Water resistance A largely overlooked new feature in the iPhone XS was the addition of a dual-SIM tray. This opened up the ability to load multiple SIM cards into one iPhone, which was a godsend for travelers overseas. </p>\\n<h3>iPhone XR - October 26, 2018</h3>\\n<p>The <a>iPhone XR</a> acted as 2018\\'s budget friendly iPhone model. This device utilized a LCD display instead of the OLED display found on the iPhone X and iPhone XS. It also included only one camera on the back, similar to iPhone 8. Overall, the iPhone XR offered a similar experience to the premium iPhone X and iPhone XS at an affordable price point.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 11 - September 20, 2019</h3>\\n<p><a>iPhone 11</a> increased the standard screen size across base models to 6.1 inches, moving from a Super Retina display to a Liquid Retina display. The device also opted for an Ultra Wide camera over the Telephoto camera found in prior dual camera models. The iPhone 11 was also the <a>first generation to offer Pro models</a>, which contained Super Retina displays, a triple camera setup, and HDR support.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone SE (2nd Gen) - April 24, 2020</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone SE 2 was a large improvement over the first SE model, with a new A13 Bionic chip that drastically improved performance. The screen size increased from 4 inches to 4.7 inches, with a True Tone display to offer the best picture quality no matter your environment. Additionally, Haptic Touch was added to the iPhone SE 2, as it was not present on the first model.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 12 - October 23, 2020</h3>\\n<p>The <a>iPhone 12</a> introduced MagSafe, a feature that allowed certain chargers and accessories to magnetically connect to the back of the iPhone. The base models received the Super Retina XDR display, providing a gorgeous OLED panel at an affordable price. iPhone 12 also added a Ceramic Shield, which proved to be tougher than glass and much more durable over time.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 13 - September 24, 2021</h3>\\n<p><a>iPhone 13</a> brought massive leaps in battery life, with up to 19 hours of video playback. New features for photography were also introduced, like Cinematic Mode, which automatically focused on objects for perfect transitions every time. The <a>iPhone 13 Pro</a> models featured ProRes video, a type of capture that allowed for raw 4K30 videos.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone SE (3rd Gen) - March 18, 2022</h3>\\n<p>Released in the Spring of 2022, <a>iPhone SE 3</a> brought back the home button for the first time in five years. Additionally, this model included 5G connectivity to take advantage of the new 5G towers that began popping up in 2021. Many of the photography features that were released in between the SE 2 and SE 3 were added to this model, including Night Mode, Photographic Styles, and more.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 14 - September 16, 2022</h3>\\n<p><a>iPhone 14</a> brought new features like Emergency SOS, which utilizes Satellite connectivity to reach response teams in the event of an emergency. Additionally, the camera system across all models received sizable upgrades, such as improved ultrawide and zoom lenses. This generation also marked the <a>return of the Plus model</a>, a standard iPhone 14 with a larger screen.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 15 - September 22, 2023</h3>\\n<p>The latest iPhone generation is none other than the <a>iPhone 15</a>. Similar to the iPhone 14, a standard, Plus, Pro, and Pro Max model are all available to purchase. The biggest changes with this generation mostly occur with the Pro models, with a new lens, titanium frame, and action button to replace to mute switch. Of course, by far the biggest change is the switch from Lightning to USB-C, which was made due to new EU regulations.</p>\\n<h2>When Is the iPhone 16 Coming Out?</h2>\\n<p>Although we don\\'t have exact details about the release of Apple\\'s next flagship iPhone, Apple\\'s release schedule has been consistent enough every year for us to make an educated guess. We expect the iPhone 16 to come out in the fall of 2024, most likely in September. We will likely learn more about the upcoming iPhone generation at <a>Apple\\'s WWDC event</a> on June 10 this year. This is usually when Apple previews major updates to its various operating systems, including iOS.</p>\\n<p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

the iPhone starts well before then in the development of multiple different projects all wrapped up under the codename <em>Project Purple</em>.</p>\\n<h3>2003: A New Way to Use Computers?</h3>\\n<p>The birth of the revolutionary technology that would eventually power the iPhone didn’t start with a grand vision for reshaping the way we communicate. It started with a plan to fix the most cumbersome parts of a computer: the mouse.</p>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>History of Apple Computers</a></p>\\n<p>In\\xa0<a>2003</a>, Apple started internal experimentation to find a way to replace the mouse with a touchpad that offered much more control and flexibility. Their initial design, a tablet-sized, finger-controlled interface known as the\\xa0<a>Model 035</a>, allowed users to pinch, scroll, and zoom – all things that were currently unavailable on modern computers.</p>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>The Genesis of Genius: Unveiling Who Invented Apple and When Was the Icon Created</a></p>\\n<p>This project was eventually put aside though when it became clear that Apple had more pressing issues…</p>\\n<h3>2004: The Rise and Fall of the iPod</h3>\\n<p>The iPod was\\xa0<a>released in 2001</a>\\xa0and quickly became not only a consumer favorite (eventually selling nearly 400 million units) but also one of\\xa0<a>Apple’s major revenue streams</a>.</p>\\n<p>But even as iPod sales were climbing rapidly, Apple’s executive team knew its days were limited. Customers were carrying around both an iPod and a mobile phone and were convinced that the mobile phones would eventually have the ability to play <a>music</a>, something that would make iPods obsolete.</p>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>The First Cell Phone: A Complete Phone History from 1920 to Present</a></p>\\n<p>To keep the company profitable and maintain its position as a market leader in tech innovation, Apple executives knew they needed to come up with the next generation of mobile phones before their competitors did.</p>\\n<h3>2005: The Rokr E1</h3>\\n<p>Apple’s first step in this direction was to partner with Motorola for the release of the <a>Rokr E1</a>. It was an iTunes-compatible mobile phone that allowed consumers to store songs and play them through an iPod-like interface. Unfortunately, its significant limitations meant it was never going to redefine the market. It was only able to hold 100 songs, its clunky interface was difficult to navigate, and its slow upload rate was frustrating to use.</p>\\n<p>These limitations made it clear to Apple that they needed to produce their own solution.</p>\\n<h3>2005: The Birth of an Idea</h3>\\n<p>The initial idea to create their own phone with a touchscreen display came straight from the top of the company.</p>\\n<p>In an appearance at the\\xa0<em>All Things D</em>\\xa0conference in\\xa0<a>2010</a>, Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder and CEO at the time, recounted the moment the idea of the iPhone was born.</p>\\n<blockquote><p>“I’ll tell you a secret. It began with the tablet. I had this idea about having a glass display, a multi-touch display you could type on with your fingers. I asked our people about it. And six months later, they came back with this amazing display. And I gave it to one of our really brilliant UI guys. He got scrolling working and some other things, and I thought, ‘My God, we can build a phone with this!’ So we put the tablet aside, and we went to work on the iPhone.”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>From there, Project Purple was born.</p>\\n<h3>2006: Project Purple</h3>\\n<p>The Apple research and development team dropped all other projects and this new mobile phone, known internally as “Project Purple,” became the top priority.</p>\\n<p>The first hurdle Apple had to overcome in developing the iPhone wasn’t related to the technology or the manufacturing. It was building a team!</p>\\n<p>To avoid their competitors discovering their category-defining innovation, Steve Jobs was adamant that no one from outside the company could work on Project Purple. He was so concerned about security that even those who were being internally recruited <a>couldn’t be told</a> what they were working on before they joined.</p>\\n<p>Once a team was chosen, they were split into two separate but closely integrated teams: hardware and software. They spent <a>many long nights and weekends</a> brainstorming, testing, and iterating different versions in their dedicated building on the Apple Cupertino campus, and conditions inside the building quickly got weird:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Very much like a dorm, people were there all the time. It smelled something like <a>pizza</a>, and in fact on the front door of the Purple Dorm we put a sign up that said ‘Fight Club’ – because the first rule of that project was to not talk about it outside those doors.”</p>\\n<cite>Scott Forstall – Apple’s Senior Vice President of iOS</cite>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Their hard work eventually yielded results when a design prototype was finalized in Spring 2006, looking quite similar to Apple’s 2004-era iPod Mini (a metallic body with rounded edges).</p>\\n<p>Internal concerns about the rounded sides making the iPhone appear too large were eventually taken on board, and only a few months before its release, the design was changed to the now-iconic rectangular body with rounded corners and a full-face glass display with a singular button.</p>\\n<h3>2007: The Last-Minute Change to Gorilla Glass</h3>\\n<p>In January 2007, Steve Jobs proudly strode onto the stage at the <a>MacWorld 2007</a> convention and unveiled the iPhone to raucous applause from loyal Apple fans. But one thing that can’t be seen clearly in that video is that the iPhone he’s holding is not the one that eventually made it into consumers’ hands.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone Steve Jobs is holding has scratches on the screen. Not because someone had used a piece of sharpened metal to gouge slivers into the glass, but because the screen on the original iPhone is made of hardened <a>plastic</a> – the same plastic used on iPod screens. </p>\\n<p>The day after his keynote address, Steve called Jeff Williams, the now-head of design at Apple and COO, and told him that the screen had to be changed to glass. Jeff’s team had already covered this:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>“I’ve been looking at that, and in 3 to 4 years, technology may evolve, and we can do that.”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Steve’s reply was simple, direct, and straightforward:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>“You don’t understand. When it ships in June, it needs to be glass.”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Two days later, Wendell Weeks, the CEO of <a>Corning</a>, called Williams after speaking with the Apple CEO. He had a solution.</p>\\n<p>In <a>1962</a>, Corning launched Project Muscle – an innovation drive to find new solutions to existing problems and invent new products.</p>\\n<p>One of the most promising inventions to come out of this project was known internally as 0317. Engineers tweaked a recently developed method for reinforcing glass and created a new type of glass so strong they could throw fortified tumblers off the roof of their 9-story headquarters without them breaking.</p>\\n<p>Their internal testing showed that while normal glass could withstand 7,000 pounds of pressure per square inch, Chemcor, as it became known, could withstand 100,000 pounds of pressure per square inch – opening up a new world of applications that were previously unsuitable for glass.</p>\\n<p>Initial interest was strong, with windshield and eye safety wear manufacturers seeing its potential, but as further testing revealed issues with how the glass shattered when it did break, Corning was forced to put the project back on their research and development shelves.</p>\\n<p>But the idea to dust it off and experiment further with it came <a>in 2005</a> with the release of the <a>Motorola Razr V3</a>. It was the first mobile to feature a glass screen and it prompted Corning to explore whether there were any modern applications for Chemcor.</p>\\n<p>Testing to reduce the thickness of the glass from its 4mm thickness hadn’t produced much progress by the time Steve Jobs called in 2007, but even though Apple was requesting 1.3mm thick super-strong glass, Corning said they could do it.</p>\\n<p><a>Hundreds of hours</a> of testing went into the development of what is now known as Gorilla Glass, and just 11 days before the first iPhone was released, Apple <a>issued a press release</a> breaking the news that the iPhone would now have a glass screen.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone Generations Development</h2>\\n<p>With each new generation of the iPhone, Apple has sought to push their phone to the limits of what is technologically capable.</p>\\n<p>Here is the complete history of the iPhone’s development, sales, access, availability, and controversies.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 1: The First iPhone</h2>\\n<p>In the months and even years leading up to the release of the first iPhone, rumors had been swirling around the web about an iPod that could also work as a phone.</p>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>The Complete History of Phones from the Last 500 Years</a></p>\\n<h3>When Did the First iPhone Come Out?</h3>\\n<p>When Steve Jobs finally took the stage at the MacWorld convention on January 9th, 2007 to announce “We’re going to reinvent the phone,” iPhone history began, and the era of smartphones was officially upon us.</p>\\n<p>Later that year, on June 29, 2007, the first iPhone was released in stores in the United States, marking the official beginning of a new era.</p>\\n<p>To say that Jobs was right that this new product would disrupt the world of phones is an understatement. By September of the same year,\\xa0<a>Apple had sold its millionth iPhone</a>. Since then, sales have grown steadily, and by 2017, they had\\xa0<a>sold more than 2 billion iPhones</a>. But what was so special and unique about this first iPhone?</p>\\n<p>RFEAD MORE: <a>Who Invented Smartphone? Unraveling the History of Mobile Technology</a></p>\\n<h3>iPhone 2G Features and Functionality</h3>\\n<p><a>According to Apple</a>, the first version of the iPhone was a combination of three products. It was: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A revolutionary mobile phone</li>\\n<li>A widescreen iPod with touch controls</li>\\n<li>A breakthrough Internet communications device with desktop-class <a>email</a>, web browsing, searching, and maps.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>It’s natural to want to anoint the innovative touch screen as the most novel feature since up until this point nothing like it existed. But the first iPhone was also a brand new phone in that it allowed people to make calls by simply pointing at and touching a name in their contacts list.</p>\\n<p>This type of functionality had never been seen before, and it helped make the iPhone truly unique. Furthermore, the introduction of Visual Voicemail made it possible for users to read their voicemails as texts instead of having to listen to them.</p>\\n<p>The first iPhone also featured a full QWERTY keyboard on a soft touchscreen. Before the iPhone, phones with full keyboards, such as the Blackberry, made use of a hard keyboard, which reduced the size of the screen. Wanting to make the iPhone a full-screen device, Apple invented a touchscreen that was more accurate and more responsive than any other phone in history.</p>\\n<p>Because of this, the first iPhone was also described as a “full-screen iPod.” This idea of having a full-screen device with a beautiful, easy-to-use interface changed the course of mobile phone history. Today, nearly all smartphones today are built using this design concept.</p>\\n<p>The other defining feature of the first iPhone was its functionality as a mobile browser and email client. Up until this point in smartphone history, surfing the web on your phone required using a mobile-specific browser that was clunky and featureless. However, with the iPhone, users could now surf the web on Apple’s Safari browser in much the same way that they could on their desktop.</p>\\n<h3>First iPhone Specs</h3>\\n<p>Another thing that amazed people about the first iPhone was its size. Despite its state-of-the-art capabilities, it was just .046 inches (11.6 mm) thick, and it weighed only 4.8 ounces (135 grams). And with a diagonal screen size of just 3.5 inches (8.89 cm), it could easily fit into your pocket or purse. In this sense, it was one of the world’s first true handheld computers. In terms of the screen, the first iPhone boasted a resolution of 320 x 400 pixels and around 160 pixels per inch (ppi), which is the standard measure of pixel density.</p>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>The First Computer: Technology that Changed the World</a></p>\\n<p>In terms of other specifications, <a>the first iPhone included</a>: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A 2-megapixel camera (the front-facing camera was not included in the first model)</li>\\n<li>A Samsung 32-bit, 412 MHz processor with 128 MB RAM (note: at this point in iPhone history, Apple was not making its own processors)</li>\\n<li>Bluetooth 2.0 capability</li>\\n<li>The first version of iOS, which was upgradable to iOS 3.3</li>\\n<li>\\n<a>WiFi</a> capability</li>\\n<li>Document viewer</li>\\n<li>Photo/video viewer</li>\\n<li>Predictive text input</li>\\n<li>3.5 mm headphone jack</li>\\n<li>Google Maps integration</li>\\n<li><a>GPS</a></li>\\n<li>HTML support</li>\\n<li>8 hours talk time on 2G</li>\\n<li>6 hours of battery life on WiFi</li>\\n<li>7 hours of battery life for videos</li>\\n<li>24 hours of battery life for watching videos</li>\\n<li>4GB internal memory ($499) or 8GB ($599)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>The First Camera Ever Made: A History of Cameras</a></p>\\n<h3>First iPhone Countries and Carriers</h3>\\n<p>By <a>Christmas</a> of 2007, Apple dropped these prices, <a>much to the chagrin of consumers</a>, and this helped to boost sales. But one of the things that really held back iPhone sales in the beginning, even though the numbers are still quite staggering, was that the phone was only available in limited countries and on limited networks.</p>\\n<p>In the U.S., for example, the iPhone was only offered through the wireless carrier Cingular. This would change in the coming years, but an <a>exclusivity contract</a> between the two companies meant that one needed to be a Cingular customer to enjoy the state-of-the-art technology included in the iPhone.</p>\\n<p>In addition to the United States, the iPhone was also sold in the United Kingdom and Germany using similar exclusive contracts like the one between Apple in Cingular.</p>\\n<p>During its first year, the iPhone also became available in Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as France. However, Apple soon ran into legal trouble as many European phone carriers sued Apple for its exclusivity contract, a move that caused a temporary halt to iPhone sales in Europe. However, despite this limited release, iPhones got into the hands of people all over the world, and expanding the market became a defining characteristic of the next chapter of iPhone history.</p>\\n<h3>First iPhone Controversy: Early Adopter Tax</h3>\\n<p>While the first iPhone was universally hailed as redefining personal communication, it wasn’t without controversy.</p>\\n<p>Its initial recommended retail price of $599 was well beyond the cost of a typical mobile phone. While this didn’t deter tens of thousands of Apple fans queuing for hours to get their hands on one, some vocal members of the public complained about the price.</p>\\n<p>Apple eventually caved to the public pressure and reduced the price to $399 after less than three months after release. Whilst those who had delayed their purchase were happy with the decision, Apple’s early adopters were outraged at having to pay an additional $200.</p>\\n<p>Apple ultimately listened to the growing frustrations of their most loyal supporters and gave them a $100 Apple gift voucher. Not exactly $200, but enough to show their supporters they were valued.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 2: iPhone 3G</h2>\\n<p>In the first year of iPhone history, there were extremely high levels of customer satisfaction, as well as figures that showed people really were using the phone in the way it was meant to be used, i.e. people were using it for email, web browsing, and calling/texting, <a>according to Steve Jobs</a>. Furthermore, he discussed how six million iPhones had been sold in the product’s first year, with sales stopping only because the company ran out of products.</p>\\n<p>However, he also identified where the iPhone needed to go next. Specifically, he pointed to five things:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The iPhone needed to be faster</li>\\n<li>The iPhone needed to be cheaper</li>\\n<li>The iPhone needed to be available in more countries</li>\\n<li>The iPhone needed to be more compatible with third-party apps</li>\\n<li>The iPhone needed to be more suited for business</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The way in which Jobs discussed these challenges was smart, as these ended up being the defining characteristics of the next chapter of iPhone history.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 3G Features and Functionality</h3>\\n<p>iPhone 3G was released on July 11, 2008. Although the iPhone 3G ushered in a new era in the history of the iPhone, it was not a tremendous upgrade from the original version of the device. It addressed many of the issues mentioned above, but many other things stayed the same.</p>\\n<p>The most important change was that the iPhone 3G, as the name suggests, was equipped with 3G capability, which meant users could browse the web and download content much faster than they could with the original iPhone.</p>\\n<p>Another major change with the iPhone 3G was the introduction of the App Store, iOS 2, and developer software that made it possible for third parties to create their own apps. Technically, this announcement came earlier in the year, but with the release of the iPhone 3G, there was now a device on which developers could place their apps. In this sense, the iPhone 3G turned the device into more than just a phone. It became a platform, a move that has helped turn Apple and the iPhone into the institutions they are today.</p>\\n<p>In terms of screen size, the iPhone 3G stayed the same as the original iPhone. However, Apple changed from using an aluminum backing to one made of polycarbonate, a move that made the iPhone 3G slightly lighter. It also allowed Apple to offer the iPhone in different colors, black or white.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 3G Specs</h3>\\n<p>There weren’t a ton of changes between the first iPhone and the iPhone 3G. For example, the phone screen stayed the same size at 3.5 inches (8.89 cm). But because of the new materials, the iPhone 3G weighed slightly less (4.7 ounces/133g as compared to 4.8 ounces/136g), and the screen resolution was bumped up to 380 x 420 pixels, giving it around 165 ppi. As for the other specs, many stayed the same, such as the processor speed and RAM, and most improvements, with the exception of 3G capability, were slight. Here’s a summary of the changes:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>3G capability</li>\\n<li>Bluetooth 2.0+EDR</li>\\n<li>iOS 2.0, but can support up to iOS 4.2 (upgraded from the original iOS)</li>\\n<li>A-GPS, which allowed for more accurate location services.</li>\\n<li>5 hours talk <a>time</a> or web browsing on 3G</li>\\n<li>10 hours talk time on 2G</li>\\n<li>6 hours of battery life on WiFi</li>\\n<li>7 hours of battery life for videos</li>\\n<li>24 hours of battery life for just <a>music</a>\\n</li>\\n<li>8 GB ($199) or 16 GB ($299) of storage space (up from 4 or 8)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>Electrifying History: Uncovering Who Invented the Battery</a></p>\\n<p>One of the biggest changes resulting from the release of the iPhone 3G was not only the increased network capacity but also the price. This new version of the iPhone retailed for less than half of the first model.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 3G Countries and Networks</h3>\\n<p>As Steve Jobs mentioned when introducing the iPhone 3G, Apple made it a priority to expand its market presence to many more countries. So, when the iPhone 3G hit the market on July 11th, 2008, it was sold in stores in the following countries:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Australia</li>\\n<li>Austria</li>\\n<li>Belgium</li>\\n<li>Canada</li>\\n<li>Denmark</li>\\n<li>Finland</li>\\n<li>Germany</li>\\n<li>Hong Kong</li>\\n<li>Ireland</li>\\n<li>Italy</li>\\n<li>Japan</li>\\n<li>Mexico</li>\\n<li>The Netherlands</li>\\n<li>New Zealand</li>\\n<li>Portugal</li>\\n<li>Spain</li>\\n<li>Sweden</li>\\n<li>Switzerland</li>\\n<li>United Kingdom</li>\\n<li>United States</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>History of Japan: The Feudal Era to the Founding of Modern Periods</a> and <a>US History Timeline: The Dates of America’s Journey</a></p>\\n<p>On July 17, 2008, the iPhone was released in France, and by August, it was released in twenty-two more countries, which were:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Argentina</li>\\n<li>Chile</li>\\n<li>Colombia</li>\\n<li>Czech Republic</li>\\n<li>Ecuador</li>\\n<li>El Salvador</li>\\n<li>Estonia</li>\\n<li>Greece</li>\\n<li>Guatemala</li>\\n<li>Honduras</li>\\n<li>Hungary</li>\\n<li>India</li>\\n<li>Liechtenstein</li>\\n<li>Macau</li>\\n<li>Paraguay</li>\\n<li>Peru</li>\\n<li>The Philippines</li>\\n<li>Poland</li>\\n<li>Romania</li>\\n<li>Singapore</li>\\n<li>Slovakia</li>\\n<li>Uruguay</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>However, despite expanding to new countries, Apple continued to make use of exclusivity contracts with certain carriers. For example, in the U.S., the iPhone was still only available through one network, AT&amp;T (formerly Cingular). However, elsewhere in the world, these exclusivity contracts were not as ironclad. The iPhone was sold on multiple networks in counties throughout Europe, and this was a sign of what was to come in the next phases of iPhone history.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 3: iPhone 3GS</h2>\\n<p>The release of the iPhone 3GS on June 19, 2009, marked a new beginning in iPhone history largely because it was the first iPhone to receive an interim update. The “S” after “3G” became Apple’s way of indicating that the phone was new but that it also maintained many of the same features as the previous version.</p>\\n<p>Part of the reason for this was that the iPhones had become so popular that people began expecting a new version every year, but the technology was not advancing fast enough for there to be a dramatically new version every year.</p>\\n<p>In fact, part of the reason why the iPhone 3G came so quickly after the first iPhone was that Apple, in 2007, felt pressure to get the first iPhone onto the market. Some even argue they rushed its release and that the iPhone 3G was the real aim of all the initial research and development that went into the phone.</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, by 2009, the iPhone had become a staple in the wireless phone market, and there was an immense incentive to come out with a new version every year to keep up with sales and rising stock prices.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 3GS Features and Functionality</h3>\\n<p>In terms of features and functionality, the iPhone 3GS did not change all that much from the iPhone 3G. It included all of the same features as the first two iPhones plus:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>VoiceOver for Accessibility</li>\\n<li>Voice control (not quite Siri, but we’re on the way)</li>\\n<li>\\n<a>Nike</a> + iPod for training </li>\\n<li>An inline remote on the headphone cable</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>These changes were nice, but what really made the iPhone 3GS different was how it was built on the inside.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 3GS Specs</h3>\\n<p>The main differences that came with the release of the iPhone 3GS were some of its internal specifications. It weighed slightly more than the iPhone 3G, but only by .1 ounces/2.8g (the total weight returned to the original 4.8 oz./136g), but the screen size and resolution stayed the same. This means that the biggest upgrades were made to the camera, the processor, and the battery. More specifically, the iPhone 3G included:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A 600 MHz processor with 256 MB RAM</li>\\n<li>A 3.0-megapixel camera that allowed for video recording</li>\\n<li>Bluetooth 2.1+EDR</li>\\n<li>A digital <a>compass</a>\\n</li>\\n<li>5 hours talk time or web browsing on 3G</li>\\n<li>12 hours talk time on 2G (up from 10)</li>\\n<li>9 hours of battery life on WiFi (up from 6)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of battery life for videos (up from 7)</li>\\n<li>30 hours of battery life for just music (up from 24)</li>\\n<li>16 GB ($199) 32 GB ($299) of internal memory (up from 8 or 16)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>iPhone 3GS Carriers and Countries</h3>\\n<p>At this point in iPhone history, the iPhone was still only available on AT&amp;T in the United States. Abroad, it was carried by several different companies, such as Vodafone, TMobile, O2, Airtel, Movistar, and many more.</p>\\n<p>With the release of the iPhone 3GS, Apple also expanded the number of countries in which the phone was available, in addition to the countries that were introduced to the iPhone with the release of the 3G, people in <a>the following countries</a> were able to purchase this revolutionary device starting in 2009:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Botswana</li>\\n<li>Brazil</li>\\n<li>Bulgaria</li>\\n<li>Cameroon</li>\\n<li>Central African Republic</li>\\n<li>Croatia</li>\\n<li>Dominican Republic</li>\\n<li>Egypt</li>\\n<li>Guinea</li>\\n<li>Indonesia</li>\\n<li>Ivory Coast</li>\\n<li>Jamaica</li>\\n<li>Jordan</li>\\n<li>Kenya</li>\\n<li>Madagascar</li>\\n<li>Mali</li>\\n<li>Mauritius</li>\\n<li>Nicaragua</li>\\n<li>Niger</li>\\n<li>Latvia</li>\\n<li>Luxembourg</li>\\n<li>Macedonia</li>\\n<li>Malaysia</li>\\n<li>Malta</li>\\n<li>Mexico</li>\\n<li>Moldova</li>\\n<li>Montenegro</li>\\n<li>Poland</li>\\n<li>Russia</li>\\n<li>Saudi Arabia</li>\\n<li>South Africa</li>\\n<li>Senegal</li>\\n<li>Taiwan</li>\\n<li>Thailand</li>\\n<li>United Arab Emirates</li>\\n<li>Venezuela</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Between the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 3Gs, Steve Jobs and Co. managed to achieve their goal of making the iPhone a truly global device. There are a few notable countries missing from this list, the most prominent being China. But considering the political climate in China and the relative difficulty U.S. companies have selling their products there, this shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. However, the size and the buying power of the Chinese market have always been too much for a company such as Apple to resist. However, it would be some time before the history of the iPhone would begin in the world’s most populous country. Nevertheless, by the end of 2009, there were iPhones in almost every corner of the globe.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 4: iPhone 4</h2>\\n<p>Some <a>30 million iPhones</a> were sold in the first three years of the phone’s history, making it one of the most popular and highly-desired products in the entire world. However, Apple, with its unquenchable thirst for innovation, wanted to move forward with the latest version of their signature device. So, the iPhone 4, which launched on June 24, 2010, was the first time in iPhone history that Apple did a complete makeover of the device.</p>\\n<p>Of course, some things stayed the same, but so much of the phone was different that it’s clear to see how the release of this device launched a new era in the history of the iPhone. Many call the iPhone 4 the first “modern phone,” largely because all subsequent models have been based on it in one way or another.</p>\\n<p>During the launch event, Jobs claimed there were more than 100 new features in the iPhone 4 as compared to the 3GS.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 4 Features and Functionality</h3>\\n<p>One of the most exciting things to come from the iPhone 4 was the release of FaceTime. Making use of the iPhone’s new front-facing camera, users could easily and clearly video chat with other iPhone users, providing people with a brand new way to communicate with one another.</p>\\n<p>The ability to use FaceTime is something that helped make the iPhone an even more important device in the lives of so many people around the world. However, what really made the iPhone 4 special were the upgrades it received on the inside as well as its brand-new design.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 4 Specs</h3>\\n<p>The most obvious difference between the iPhone 4 and all previous models is how it looked. The first versions of the phone were made from glass and plastic, but for the first time ever, a phone was made from stainless steel, which Apple claimed made it stronger and lighter than any other phone in history.</p>\\n<p>One thing that was interesting about this phone was that Apple built the antennae directly into the phone’s stainless steel frame. This was initially lauded as a feat in engineering, but after some time, it was discovered that this design element actually impeded the phone’s ability to make calls.</p>\\n<p>For example, putting your hand near the bottom of the phone would cause signal strength to suffer, and it even caused some calls to drop. <a>Steve Jobs famously denied</a> this was an issue when it was brought to his attention by the press and users, a scandal that became known as Atennaegate, but he eventually admitted the design flaw. In the meantime, Apple gave the iPhone 4 users a bumper to put around the phone that prevented signal issues.</p>\\n<p>However, despite this problem, the iPhone 4 was still one of the most innovative versions of the device to ever be released. It was a full 25 percent thinner than the iPhone 3GS, but it still weighed 4.8 ounces/136g. The screen size remained the same, but it received a major upgrade. The new version’s resolution was improved to 960 x 640 pixels. However, the biggest upgrade came in pixel density. The Phone 4 screen produced 326ppi, which was twice that of all previous models, giving the iPhone 4 the clearest screen in iPhone history.</p>\\n<p>Apple dubbed this “Retina display” because it claimed this level of clarity was higher than that which the human eye could perceive, making text on the screen appear more like that of a printed book. This claim came under scrutiny, but nevertheless, these specs made the phone’s screen one of the clearest and most precise the world has seen. It would be seven years before Apple came out with a screen better than this one.</p>\\n<p>Other device specs include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A 5-megapixel rear camera with LED flash capable of recording videos in 720p</li>\\n<li>A VGA-quality front-facing camera for FaceTime</li>\\n<li>A 32-bit, Apple A4 processor, with speeds up to 1GHz and 512MB of RAM (the first time Apple included its own processor in the device)</li>\\n<li>A Micro-sim tray (GSM versions only)</li>\\n<li>2 microphones, one for noise canceling to help make calls clearer</li>\\n<li>A 3-axis gyroscope</li>\\n<li>iOS 4.0, upgradable to iOS 7</li>\\n<li>7 hours talk time on 3G (up from 6)</li>\\n<li>6 hours of web browsing time on 3G (up from 5)</li>\\n<li>14 hours talk time on 2G (up from 12)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of battery life on WiFi (up from 9)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of battery life for videos (no change)</li>\\n<li>40 hours of battery life for just music (up from 30)</li>\\n<li>16 GB ($199) 32 GB ($299) of internal memory (no change) with a two-year contract with AT&amp;T</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>Who Invented The Microphone? The Story of Alexander Graham Bell</a></p>\\n<h3>iPhone 4 Countries and Carriers</h3>\\n<p>In terms of new countries and carriers, not much changed with the release of the iPhone 4. However, in February 2011, before the release of the next version of the iPhone, Apple released a new version of the device that could function on CDMA networks. This marked an important moment in iPhone history as it meant that the phone could <a>now work on Verizon</a> and Sprint in the U.S., which effectively ended the exclusivity between Apple and AT&amp;T that had defined the first three years of iPhone history. On February 10, 2011, <a>Verizon sold its first iPhone</a>, and in October of that year, <a>the phone became available to Sprint customers</a> as well.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 4 Controversy: Antenna-Gate</h3>\\n<p>As sales of the iPhone 4 continued to climb, consumers started to notice an annoying glitch – when they held their phone in a particular way, <a>they lost reception</a>. The existence of this issue was repeatedly denied by Apple execs.</p>\\n<p>As public awareness and frustration with this issue continued to grow, Apple finally acknowledged it as a real problem.</p>\\n<p>Their solution was not well received – “Just avoid holding it in that way.”</p>\\n<p>The considerable backlash to this obviously inadequate solution prompted Apple to eventually offer free cases to all iPhone 4 users.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 5: iPhone 4S</h2>\\n<p>After several years of releasing the iPhone in the summer, Apple changed things up in 2011 by releasing the newest version of the device in October. Much like the iPhone 3GS, the iPhone 4S was an interim update to the phone. It gave it some new features and increased functionality, but most of the device stayed the same.</p>\\n<p>However, the iPhone, for the first time ever, had become available on all three major U.S. networks, opening the door for record first-weekend sales. More than 1 million were sold on the first day, and <a>Apple sold just over 4 million on the first weekend</a>.</p>\\n<p>But the release of the iPhone 4S will go down in iPhone history as a momentous one for other reasons. Steve Jobs, one of Apple’s founders and one of the world’s most well-known entrepreneurs, passed away from pancreatic cancer just nine days before the phone was released to the world.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 4S Features and Functionality</h3>\\n<p>The previous few upgrades Apple made to the iPhone were centered on improving its speed, screen, and cameras. The iPhone 4S was upgraded in all of these areas, but it also included some exciting new features that had never before been seen in iPhone history.</p>\\n<p>Perhaps the most exciting change was the introduction of Siri, Apple’s voice-controlled assistant that is still in use today and that in many ways introduced the consumer world to the functionality of Artificial Intelligence.</p>\\n<p>In addition to Siri, Apple also introduced iCloud, which allowed people to store photos, videos, music, contacts, and much more in the cloud, which freed up space on the device, something they most likely did in response to the complaint that there was never enough storage space on the iPhone. Apple also introduced iMessage to make texting between iPhone users easier, a notifications center, reminders, and Twitter integration helping the iPhone stay at the top of the smartphone world.</p>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>Who Invented Twitter? The Origins of a Revolutionary Social Media Platform</a></p>\\n<h3>iPhone 4S Specs</h3>\\n<p>When the iPhone 3GS was released, we were told the “S” stood for “speed,” meaning the focus of the upgrade was on making the phone faster. This was the case with the iPhone 4S, but the device also received other upgrades. Screen resolution and size stayed the same, but the iPhone 4S also included:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>An 8-megapixel camera capable of shooting videos in 1080p (up from 5 mp and 720p)</li>\\n<li>An Apple A5, 32-bit, dual-core processor with speeds up to 1 GHz and 512 MB RAM</li>\\n<li>Bluetooth 4.0</li>\\n<li>iOS 5 (upgradeable to iOS 9)</li>\\n<li>8 hours talk time on 3G (up from 7)</li>\\n<li>6 hours of web browsing time on 3G (no change)</li>\\n<li>14 hours talk time on 2G (no change)</li>\\n<li>9 hours of battery life on WiFi (down from 10)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of battery life for videos (no change)</li>\\n<li>40 hours of battery life for just music (up from 30)</li>\\n<li>16GB ($199) 32GB ($299), or 64GB ($399) of internal memory (64GB model was added with the 4S)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Despite a host of new features and upgraded specs, <a>Apple received a good deal of criticism</a> from the general public for not doing enough with the iPhone 4S. By 2011, 4G LTE networks were growing in popularity, and many thought Apple would take the leap and release a phone ready to handle faster network speeds. However, analysts dubbed this release as a move towards the future, as the 4S set up the release of the iPhone 5, which really would change the course of iPhone history forever.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 4S Countries and Carriers</h3>\\n<p>One of the biggest things to happen with the release of the iPhone 4S was making the device available on all three major U.S. networks, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon.</p>\\n<p>In terms of countries, though, the iPhone 4S is monumental because it was the first time a full version of the iPhone was released in China. Counterfeit and stolen devices had been on the market for years, and in 2011 Apple released a version of the iPhone 3GS that didn’t have WiFi, but in January 2012, <a>the iPhone 4S went to China</a>, giving Apple unprecedented access to one of the world’s largest markets.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 6: iPhone 5</h2>\\n<p>While for some the release of the iPhone 5 came a year late, there’s no doubt that it was an exciting moment in iPhone history, mainly because it was the first iPhone to make use of the ultra-fast LTE networks being offered by AT&amp;T and Verizon at the time. However, this was far from the only upgrade made with the iPhone 5.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 5 Features and Functionality</h3>\\n<p>While the iPhone 5 represented an exciting change in the hardware and software Apple used to make its devices, this new version did not offer much in terms of new features, but there were some, such as:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>An improved Siri</li>\\n<li>Apple Maps with turn-by-turn navigation</li>\\n<li>Apple Passbook (the precursor to Apple Wallet)</li>\\n<li>Do Not Disturb</li>\\n<li>FaceTime over cellular networks (previously, it only worked on WiFi)</li>\\n<li>\\n<a>Facebook</a> integration</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>These upgrades certainly made the device better, but the real improvements came with its specifications.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 5 Specs</h3>\\n<p>The biggest change that came with the iPhone 5 was related to the display. After years of an iPhone with a 3.5-inch display, Apple finally made a change by expanding the screen to 4 inches. They also made the screen taller, giving it a resolution of 1136 x 640, a perfect 16:9 aspect ratio. Apple kept the 326 ppi Retina display, but by making the device taller, it fit more easily into a user’s hand.</p>\\n<p>Another major change came with the materials. After switching from glass and plastic to glass and stainless steel with the iPhone 4, Apple decided to change once again and make the iPhone 5 with glass and aluminum, a move that made this the lightest device in iPhone history. It weighed just 3.95 ounces (112 grams), which is 20 percent lower than the iPhone 4 and 4S. The iPhone 5 was also considerably thinner, and part of the reason Apple was able to do this was that it found a way to embed touch sensors into the screen, eliminating the need to put an extra layer on the phone to detect your fingers, something that naturally made the phone thicker.</p>\\n<p>One more upgrade, one that many people didn’t like at the time, was the switch from a 30-pin connector that had been in use since the first iPod to a digital lightning connector. This meant the new iPhone needed a new charger, but it also allowed for faster charging speeds. Other specifications of the iPhone 5 include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>An 8-megapixel camera capable of recording in 1080p (camera stayed the same, but video quality was upgraded from 720p)</li>\\n<li>A 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera (previous only VGA-quality, which is around 0.3 megapixels)</li>\\n<li>An Apple A6, 32-bit, dual-core processor capable of speeds up to 1.3 GHz and 1GB of RAM (up from 1GHz and 512MB RAM)</li>\\n<li>LTE capability (first iPhone to have this)</li>\\n<li>iOS 6</li>\\n<li>8 hours talk time on 3G (no change)</li>\\n<li>8 hours of web browsing time on 3G (up from 6)</li>\\n<li>8 hours of web browsing time on LTE</li>\\n<li>10 hours of battery life on WiFi (restored to iPhone 4 levels)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of battery life for videos (no change)</li>\\n<li>40 hours of battery life for just music (up from 30)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>iPhone 5 Countries and Carriers</h3>\\n<p>By now, the iPhone was being sold on countless networks in countless countries. Just over five million iPhones were sold the first weekend the iPhone 5 was available, the most ever for the first weekend, although this number disappointed\\xa0<a>stockholders who were expecting sales figures to be much higher</a>. The phone launched in the US, Canada, Australia, and most of Europe on September 21, 2012, and by the end of the year,\\xa0<a>it was available in more than 100 countries</a>\\xa0around the world.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 7: iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C</h2>\\n<p>The release of the iPhone 5S and 5C marks an interesting moment in iPhone history, largely because it was the first time Apple released two iPhones at one time. Part of the reason for this was that Apple was now up against more competition than ever. Other phone companies, such as Samsung, had begun releasing phones that could do similar things as the iPhone, and to keep up, Apple needed to offer people more options. The differences between the iPhone 5S and 5C demonstrate this new perspective.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 5C</h3>\\n<p>The first thing you notice with the iPhone 5C is color. For the first time ever, Apple offered customers the chance to buy an iPhone in a color other than black or white. The 5C had five color options: green, blue, yellow, pink, and white. The iPhone 5C also had a polycarbonate shell over steel, which made it slightly thicker (.35 inches/88mm thicker than the 4S and, .05 inches/12mm thicker than the 5 or 5S), and it also weighed slightly more (4.66 ounces/132g, .07 oz/2g less)</p>\\n<p>Beyond these slight changes in appearance, however, the iPhone 5C was really not all that much different than the iPhone 5. It featured a slightly better camera, although improvements were made to how the phone processes photos instead of megapixels. It had the same processor, and Apple offered a 16 and 32GB version of the iPhone 5C, choosing not to offer the 64GB version that came with the iPhone 5. The 5C did, however, have slightly improved battery life. Official metrics were:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>10 hours talk time on 3G (up from 8)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of web browsing time on 3G (up from 8)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of web browsing time on LTE (up from 8)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of battery life on WiFi (no change)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of battery life for videos (no change)</li>\\n<li>40 hours of battery life for just music (no change)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>iPhone 5S</h3>\\n<p>Of the two phones released in 2013, the iPhone 5S was the one that really stepped things up, although some of the changes were considerably more modest as compared to past upgrades.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 5S Features and Functionality</h3>\\n<p>The most exciting new feature to come with the iPhone 5S was the introduction of biometrics. This allowed users to scan their fingerprint into the phone and unlock the device doing nothing more than touching their finger to the home button.</p>\\n<p>Another interesting feature of the iPhone 5S was the ability to record videos in slo-mo. This move was likely in response to the fact that phones had become much more than phones. They were now cameras and so much more, and Apple responded by improving the functions the phone’s camera could perform.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 5S also came with Touch 3D, which allowed users to navigate the touchscreen with more than one finger, an addition that allowed people to be able to zoom in on photos or map much more easily.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 5S Specs</h3>\\n<p>At first glance, the iPhone 5S looks to be exactly the same as the iPhone 5. Both phones are the same size, they have identical screens (4-inch/10 cm screen, 1136 x 640 pixels, 326 ppi Retina display), and they weigh exactly the same. However, the iPhone 5S had several new features, and these were made possible by some rather significant upgrades to what’s inside the iPhone, mostly to its speed, as the designation “S” would indicate. Here are some of the things that were new with the iPhone 5S</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>An 8-megapixel rear camera with an improved aperture and two-tone flash to improve photo quality in low <a>light</a>\\n</li>\\n<li>An Apple A7 dual-core, 64-bit, 1.4 GHz processor with 1GB RAM</li>\\n<li>An M7 Motion Coprocessor helps the phone process sensory data, such as movement and orientation.</li>\\n<li>iOS 7</li>\\n<li>10 hours talk time on 3G (up from 8)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of web browsing time on 3G (up from 8)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of web browsing time on LTE (up from 8)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of battery life on WiFi (no change)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of battery life for videos (no change)</li>\\n<li>40 hours of battery life for just music (no change)</li>\\n<li>16GB ($199), 32GB ($299), 64GB($399)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>iPhone 5S and 5C Countries and Carriers</h3>\\n<p>When the iPhone 5 was released, sales figures disappointed, despite selling five million phones in the first weekend. Perhaps this slight disappointment in terms of the number of sales was why Apple decided to come out with two phones simultaneously. And if it was, then Apple made the right move, for they sold <a>just over nine million iPhones</a> on the day these phones were released.</p>\\n<p>Continuing the trend Apple set with its previous iPhones, the iPhones 5S and 5C were first released in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Europe, on September 20, 2013, and by the end of that year, the device was available in countries where the iPhone 5 was sold. However, since this version, as well as the iPhone 5, were LTE devices, the device was not available until the network had been updated.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 8: iPhone 6 and 6 Plus</h2>\\n<p>At this point in iPhone history, the yearly release of the new device had become more than tradition. Although some of the initial shock and awe had worn off, people still lined up for the new device, and first-weekend sales continued to be through the roof. However, at this point in the history of the iPhone, we can raise an important question: what else can they do?</p>\\n<p>However, this type of thinking is typical of those who aren’t working on the inside. We look at these devices and consider them magic, whereas the engineers developing them see them as works in progress. Then, when the new phone comes out, we’re once again wowed at their ability to make a product many already considered great even better.</p>\\n<p>One thing Apple did with this iPhone that had nothing to do with the device itself was release two versions at the same time. The only other time this had been done in iPhone history was with the release of the iPhone 5C and 5S, but these were interim models. The release of the iPhone 6 was the first time it was done with a completely new model.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 6 and 6 Plus Upgrades and Improvements</h3>\\n<p>The most noticeable difference with the iPhone 6 was the screen. The iPhone 5 gave us a 4-inch screen that was taller and made it easier for the phone to fit in our hands. However, with the iPhone 6, the screen was now 4.7 inches/11.9cm with a resolution of 1334 x 750 pixels, and it continued to have 326 ppi. The iPhone 6 Plus, on the other hand, had an even bigger screen. It measured 5.5 inches/14cm with a resolution of 1920 x 1080, giving it a pixel density of 401 ppi. Apple dubbed this “Retina display HD.” Both screens had a sharper contrast, which made the colors more vivid.</p>\\n<p>Because of their difference in size, the iPhone 6 Plus was slightly heavier than the iPhone 6. It weighed 6.07 ounces/172g. The 6 weighed 4.55 ounces/128g, which was 0.11 ounces, or 3 grams, less than the iPhone 5. However, beyond these superficial differences, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were identical.</p>\\n<p>Both offered an exciting new feature known as Near Field Communication (NFC). This enabled the iPhone to be used as a payment device, and it gave birth to Apple Pay, a service that allows people to pay for things by simply placing their phone next to a payment terminal. It took some time for this technology to become more mainstream, but part of the reason it did was because of the iPhone 6. Here’s a summary of the improved specs for both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>An 8-megapixel camera with increased slo-mo capabilities.</li>\\n<li>An Apple A8, 64 bit, 1.4 GHz processor with 1 GB RAM</li>\\n<li>An M8 Motion Coprocessor</li>\\n<li>iOS 8</li>\\n<li>Bluetooth 4.2</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Battery life, however, is slightly different depending on the model. The battery in the iPhone 6 received modest upgrades, whereas the battery in the iPhone 6 Plus got quite a bit better. Here are the details of battery life for the iPhone 6:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>14 hours talk time on 3G (up from 10)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of web browsing time on 3G (no change)</li>\\n<li>10 hours of web browsing time on LTE (no change)</li>\\n<li>11 hours of battery life on WiFi (up from 10)</li>\\n<li>11 hours of battery life for videos (no change)</li>\\n<li>50 hours of battery life for just music (up from 40)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Here is what the iPhone 6 Plus could do as compared to the iPhone 5S:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>24 hours talk time on 3G (up from 10)</li>\\n<li>12 hours of web browsing time on 3G (no change)</li>\\n<li>12 hours of web browsing time on LTE (no change)</li>\\n<li>12 hours of battery life on WiFi (up from 10)</li>\\n<li>14 hours of battery life for videos (no change)</li>\\n<li>80 hours of battery life for just music (up from 40)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>As for internal storage, there were three versions of each: 16GB ($199/$299), 64GB ($299/$399), and 128GB ($399/$499)</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 6 and 6 Plus Sales</h3>\\n<p>To give you an idea of just how much of a tradition the release date of new models had become in iPhone history, consider that <a>Apple sold 10 million phones on the first weekend</a> the phone was available. This beat the record of nine million that had been set with the release of the iPhone 5S and 5C, and it demonstrates just how popular these devices had become.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 6 Controversy 1: An Unwanted Gift</h3>\\n<p>To coincide with the release of the iPhone 6, Apple struck a deal with U2 to release their new album <em><em>Songs of Innocence</em>\\xa0</em><a>exclusively on iTunes\\xa0as a gift to all iTunes users.</a> This not only resulted in the largest album release of all time, with over half a BILLION users in the Apple database but also\\xa0<a>considerable backlash</a>\\xa0from those who didn’t want it<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>The negative press eventually led to Apple releasing a tool that allowed users to remove the album from their purchase history.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 6 Controversy 2: Bendgate</h3>\\n<p>Within weeks of the launch of the iPhone 6 and the U2 drama, another issue became apparent: the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus would bend if enough pressure was applied.</p>\\n<p>Apple denied that Bendgate was the result of any design or manufacturing flaw and that\\xa0<a>only 9 people</a>\\xa0had experienced any issues under normal use conditions. Although, they did acknowledge that as per their warranty conditions, if the iPhone had been subject to normal use conditions and was faulty,\\xa0<a>it would be replaced</a>.</p>\\n<figure><figcaption><a>Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Despite their public denials of any design or manufacturing issues, <a>internal Apple documents</a>, unsealed in 2018 by Lucy Koh in the ‘<a>Touch Disease</a>‘ class-action lawsuit, show that Apple was aware that the iPhone 6 was 3.3 times more likely to bend than the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6 Plus was 7.2 times more likely to bend.</p>\\n<figure><figcaption><a>Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Apple eventually made significant design changes to help prevent this issue with the addition of <a>Series 7000 space-grade aluminum</a>, even though they have never publically acknowledged an issue existed.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 9: iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus</h2>\\n<p>Like the other interim updates in iPhone history, the release of\\xa0the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus was designed to offer slight upgrades on the previous version. However, these slight upgrades brought significant improvements to the phone’s performance and user experience. user experience. Like the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the 6S and 6S Plus are almost identical. The only difference is that the iPhone 6S is larger than the iPhone 6.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 6S and 6S Plus Upgrades and Improvements</h3>\\n<p>As is typical in iPhone history, the improvements to this version of the phone came mostly on the inside. However, one noticeable difference in terms of features and functionality is that this version of the phone was the first to have 3D touch. This allowed the phone to distinguish between a tap, a light press, and a hard press, which allowed for more features and made the phone easier to use.</p>\\n<p>On the inside, the upgrades made to this phone were of similar nature as previous updates, meaning it was faster and had better battery life. But the iPhone 6S also had an improved camera, something that hadn’t happened for some time in iPhone history. Just like the first version of the iPhone 6, the Plus was larger, but the iPhone 6S Plus was the same size as the original iPhone 6 Plus.</p>\\n<p>In terms of specs, here’s what was new with the iPhone 6S:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A 12-megapixel camera (up from 8) capable of recording videos in 4K</li>\\n<li>A 5-megapixel front-facing camera</li>\\n<li>An Apple A9, dual-core, 64-bit processor with 2 GB RAM (up from 1 GB)</li>\\n<li>An M9 Motion Coprocessor</li>\\n<li>iOS 9</li>\\n<li>Bluetooth 4.2</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Internal storage options and prices remained the same. There were three different options, 16GB ($199/$299), 64GB ($299/$399), and 128GB ($399/$499). In terms of battery life, both versions of the phone received an upgrade. The Plus version naturally has more battery life since the battery is physically larger. Here’s a summary of how long the battery lasts for different tasks on each device:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>14/24 hours talk time on 3G</li>\\n<li>10/12 hours of web browsing time on 3G</li>\\n<li>10/12 hours of web browsing time on LTE</li>\\n<li>11/12 hours of battery life on WiFi</li>\\n<li>11/14 hours of battery life for videos</li>\\n<li>50/80 hours of battery life for just music</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>iPhone 6 Sales</h3>\\n<p>Initial sales of the iPhone 6S allowed Apple to once again break its own record in terms of first-weekend sales. Reports indicate it sold just over 13 million phones on the first weekend. However, many argue that the iPhone 6S was a turning point in Apple’s history. Explosive growth became harder to achieve after this phone as competition ramped up and as it became more and more difficult for Apple to come up with new “must-have” features. Nonetheless, the iPhone remained Apple’s core product, and its subsequent versions would add colorful chapters to the history of the iPhone.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 10: iPhone SE</h2>\\n<p>Just six months after the release of the iPhone 6S, Apple decided to release yet another iPhone. However, this phone was not designed so much as a groundbreaking device but rather as a response to the market.</p>\\n<p>After selling 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, Apple decided to introduce an upgraded version of the iPhone 5 largely because it has learned that some people just prefer smaller, more compact phones. The phone was upgraded as compared to the original iPhone 5, and it was designated SE, which means Special Edition. Here are the specs of the iPhone SE:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>4-inch screen</li>\\n<li>4.0 ounces (second lightest device in iPhone history)</li>\\n<li>A9, dual-core, 64-bit, 1.83 GHz processor with 2GB RAM</li>\\n<li>12-megapixel rear camera</li>\\n<li>1.2-megapixel front camera</li>\\n<li>iOS 9.3</li>\\n<li>NFC</li>\\n<li>Bluetooth 4.2</li>\\n<li>24 hours talk time on 3G</li>\\n<li>12 hours of web browsing time on 3G</li>\\n<li>13 hours of web browsing time on LTE</li>\\n<li>13 hours of battery life on WiFi</li>\\n<li>13 hours of battery life for videos</li>\\n<li>50 hours of battery life for just music</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Essentially, the iPhone SE took many of the hardware upgrades that came from the iPhone 6 and 6S and put them into a phone that looked more like the iPhone 5, giving those who prefer smaller phones the best of both worlds.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 11: iPhone 7</h2>\\n<p>Just about a year after the release of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Apple once again unleashed a new set of its signature device. At first glance, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus don’t appear to be all that different from the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but there was one major change to the appearance. <strong>Apple got rid of the headphone jack.</strong>This was the first time in iPhone history that users would have to connect their headphones via BlueTooth, and the company was <a>heavily criticized</a> for this move.</p>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>Who Invented Bluetooth? Story of the Bit Bouncer</a></p>\\n<p>However, most people liked what Apple did with the rest of the phone. For example, this was the first iPhone to be water and dust-resistant, and the introduction of iOS 10 made apps such as Maps, Photos, and Music run more smoothly, and it also introduced some new features to Messages, such as <a>special effects for messages</a>.</p>\\n<p>As for other upgrades, the iPhone 7 received the usual gambit of improvements, such as an improved processor and better battery life. Screen sizes stayed basically the same, as did screen resolution and pixel density. In addition to screen size, the 7 Plus featured two rear cameras to help deliver even better quality images. However, beyond this, the two phones were pretty much the same. Here is a summary of what was new with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>7-megapixel front-facing camera</li>\\n<li>Apple A10 quad-core, 64-bit, 2.3 GHz processor with 2GB RAM (3GB for 7 Plus)</li>\\n<li>M10 Motion Coprocessor</li>\\n<li>Stereo speakers</li>\\n<li>iOS 10</li>\\n<li>14 (7)/21(7+) hours talk time on 3G</li>\\n<li>12/13 hours of web browsing time on 3G</li>\\n<li>12/13 hours of web browsing time on LTE</li>\\n<li>14/15 hours of battery life on WiFi</li>\\n<li>13/14 hours of battery life for videos</li>\\n<li>40/60 hours of battery life for just music</li>\\n<li>32GB, 128GB, 256GB ($449-659)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>One thing to note here is the higher prices, which resulted from the decision by many wireless carriers to stop offering discounts for two-year contracts. Instead, customers had to pay for phones in full, either upfront or via monthly payments, which increased the cost to the customer, although these numbers were close to what the phones cost all throughout iPhone history.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 12: iPhone 8 and 8 Plus</h2>\\n<p>The two new models were released on September 22, 2017. For the first time in the history of the iPhone, Apple chose not to release an “S” version of their previous iPhone. Instead, they skipped right to the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. However, if you’ve been paying attention to the last few chapters of iPhone history, you’ve likely noticed that the previous versions offered little in terms of radically new features. Instead, Apple chose to simply install faster processors and better cameras, as these were the things the public demanded. With the iPhone 8, things were not much different.</p>\\n<p>However, Apple did introduce one new thing with the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus: inductive charging, which is often referred to more commonly as wireless charging. This feature allows the iPhone to be charged without being plugged in, although you need a special device to make this work.</p>\\n<p>The only other major novelty to come with the iPhone 8 was an improved processor. This new version of the phone has an Apple A11 quad-core, 64-bit, 2.4 Ghz processor with 2GB RAM (3GB for plus.) The motion coprocessor was improved to an M11, and the camera lens was also upgraded slightly. Furthermore, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus came with the newest version of Apple’s operating system, iOS 12, and there were two choices in terms of internal memory: 64GB and 256 GB. Prices ranged from $599-849.</p>\\n<p>Battery life stayed the same for the most part, but it actually decreased for some tasks Here’s how long the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus could last by activity:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>14 (7)/21(7+) hours talk time on 3G</li>\\n<li>12/13 hours of web browsing time on 3G</li>\\n<li>12/13 hours of web browsing time on LTE</li>\\n<li>12/13 hours of battery life on WiFi</li>\\n<li>13/14 hours of battery life for videos</li>\\n<li>40/60 hours of battery life for just music</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Generation 13: iPhone X</h2>\\n<p>iPhone X was released on November 3, 2017. After some years of releasing iPhones that were more or less the same as the previous year’s version but with slight improvements, Apple once again went for shock value when it released the iPhone X, a moment that was supposed to mark a new beginning in the history of the iPhone. Apple also broke with recent tradition when releasing this phone by only offering one version of the device.</p>\\n<p>All versions of the iPhone that have been released since 2017 have been modeled off the iPhone X, and we can expect that to continue in the future. But no one really knows for sure.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone X Features and Functionality</h3>\\n<p>The first thing that jumps out about the iPhone X is that it is all screen. Apple did away with much of the material surrounding the screen, and it put in an OLED display that covers the entire surface of the phone. In doing this, though, Apple made a big change: it got rid of its signature “Home button.” This created a major change in the user experience, as you now need to swipe up with your finger to exit apps and switch between screens. Doing away with the Home button, though, means there is no more Touch ID. But to compensate, the iPhone X has facial recognition, meaning all you need to do is look at your phone to unlock it.</p>\\n<p>Another new feature of the iPhone X are Aniemojis, which are emojis that move on the screen and that can be created using an avatar based on your own face. While this is hardly a technological breakthrough, it certainly made the iPhone more fun.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone X Specs</h3>\\n<p>Although the iPhone X has a whole host of new internal features, it’s hard to not start with the screen. First, at 5.6 inches/14.2cm, it’s larger than the screen found on any other iPhone. Second, the iPhone X is the first in iPhone history to have an all-OLED screen. This allows it to have a screen resolution of 2436 x 1125 pixels, which provides 458 ppi. Apple has dubbed this screen Super Retina.</p>\\n<p>Other improvements included in the iPhone X are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Two 12-megapixel rear cameras</li>\\n<li>A 7-megapixel TrueDepth front-facing camera that can recognize facial expressions and which powers Face ID</li>\\n<li>Augmented reality capabilities</li>\\n<li>An A11 Bionic processor features 6 cores, 2.4 GHz, and 3GB RAM</li>\\n<li>iOS 11</li>\\n<li>Bluetooth 5.0</li>\\n<li>21 hours of talk time</li>\\n<li>12 hours of internet use</li>\\n<li>13 hours of wireless video playback</li>\\n<li>64 GB ($999) or 256 GB ($1149)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>These phones are getting more expensive. The first iPhone, which retailed between $499 and $599, was deemed “too expensive” at the time, but by 2017, Apple was charging $1,000 for their devices, a change that indicates a shift in consumer preferences. In short, phones are no longer just phones. They are mini-computers and people are willing to pay top dollar for them.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone X Reception</h3>\\n<p>While the iPhone X was certainly a big step forward in iPhone history, some were skeptical it was the right move for the company. The device was expensive, and it marked a big change from all the phones it had released up until that point. However, shortly after its release, the iPhone X did indeed become the top-selling iPhone model, and it also helped to boost sales for other iPhones, as people who wanted a new device but who didn’t want to spend the money opted for the iPhone 8 or 8 Plus. Of course, the iPhone X wasn’t without its doubters, but it still proved to be a big step forward for a company that has become synonymous with smartphone innovation.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 14.1: iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max</h2>\\n<p>Returning to its tradition of releasing an “S” version, the next chapter in the history of the iPhone came with the release of the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Plus on September 21, 2018. The main goal of this upgrade was to improve upon the iPhone X, a phone which made considerable changes to\\xa0the look and functionality of the iPhone, while also improving its speed. In the process of doing this, Apple also made the phone almost completely water and dust-resistant.</p>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>Who Invented Water? History of the Water Molecule</a></p>\\n<h3>iPhone XS and XS Max Improvements and Upgrades</h3>\\n<p>Although Apple put quite a bit of work into making the XS and XS Max seem significantly different than the iPhone X, in reality, the phones are very similar. The X and the XS are almost identical in size, except the XS weighs .01 ounces less. The XS Max, by design, is larger. It has a 6.5 inch/16.5cm screen as compared to 5.8 inches/14.7, and it weighs about an ounce more than the iPhone XS.</p>\\n<p>Both phones got an upgraded camera, largely with improved HDR and image stabilization technology, and although the front-facing camera remained the same, Apple updated the technology to make sure Face ID works more quickly.</p>\\n<p>Probably the most significant upgrade is in the processor. Apple improved upon its A11 processor and put an A12 processor with six cores in the iPhone XS and XS Max. It has 4GB of RAM and is capable of speeds up to 2.49 GHz, and it comes preloaded with iOS 12</p>\\n<p>Both the XS and XS Max are available in 64GB, 256GB, and 512GB models, and prices range from $999-$1349. Lastly, battery life was slightly improved. With the XS and XS Max, you get:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>20/25 hours of talk time</li>\\n<li>12/13 hours of internet use</li>\\n<li>14/15 hours of wireless video playback</li>\\n<li>60/65 hours of audio playback</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Generation 14.2: iPhone XR</h2>\\n<p>The iPhone XR was announced at the same time as the iPhone XS, but it was released after it on October 26, 2018. It was designed to be a “budget” option of the iPhone XS, although with a starting price tag of $799, it’s tough to justify that moniker. It possesses some of the features of the XS, such as the super-fast A12 Bionic processor, but it is missing some others, such as the OLED, Super Retina display.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone XR Changes</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone XR’s screen got a significant upgrade from that of the iPhone 8, but it did not quite match that of the iPhone X or XS. For example, instead of using an OLED screen, the iPhone X has a “Liquid LCD”\\xa0 screen with a resolution of 1792 x 828 pixels. Pixel density is 326 ppi, which is the same as Apple’s original Retina display, although improvements in color and contrast help make the image clearer and more vivid.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone XR has the same processor as the iPhone XS, the A12 Bionic, meaning it is significantly faster than the iPhone 8. But instead of 4GB of RAM, the iPhone XR only has three. Like the iPhone XS, the XR is also preloaded with iOS 12.</p>\\n<p>Furthermore, the camera on the XR is not as good as that of the XS, although it’s much better than the iPhone 8. The main difference is that the iPhone XR does not have a telephoto lens, whereas the iPhone XS does.</p>\\n<p>Battery life on the iPhone XR is similar to that of the XS, and in some areas, it is actually slightly better. Here’s what you get with the iPhone XR:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>25 hours of talk time</li>\\n<li>15 hours of internet use</li>\\n<li>16 hours of wireless video playback</li>\\n<li>65 hours of audio playback</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Lastly, the iPhone XR is slightly cheaper than the iPhone XS, which was one of the main reasons Apple released this phone. There are three models (64GB, 128GB, and 256 GB), and the lowest option costs $749 whereas the highest prices at $899.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 15.1: iPhone 11</h2>\\n<p>Perhaps the most exciting thing to come from the release of the iPhone in, 2019, is Apple’s decision to abandon its confusing lettering system to return to good ‘ole numbers. Many likely remember when Apple randomly jumped from the iPhone 8 to the iPhone X, which many assumed was a transition to Roman numerals. But what about the iPhone 9? And are they really going to call the next one iPhone XI??</p>\\n<p>If you’re sweating, don’t worry. We are too. Thankfully, Apple decided to return back to its traditional numbering system (quietly skipping over number 9) and on September 10, 2019, released the iPhone 11.</p>\\n<p>However, despite this revolutionary reverse to what it’s always been doing, there aren’t a ton of new features on the phone’s 15th generation model. But there are of course some things to be excited about.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 11</h3>\\n<p>The basic model of 2019’s iPhone is the iPhone 11. It’s the newest model of the iPhone XR, which was designed to be the more budget-friendly option of the iPhone X, and XS.</p>\\n<p>The look and feel of the phone has not changed much with its update because Apple instead decided to improve on some of the phone’s other features, such as its processor (upgraded to an A13 Bionic) and camera, or cameras.</p>\\n<p>As with the iPhone XR, the iPhone 11 has two rear cameras, but the newer version is equipped with a 12-megapixel lens. It also offers the option to take wide-angle and “Ultra wide-angle” photos. Other features include a new night mode to improve low-light photography and 4k video capability.</p>\\n<p>Apple has also improved its front-facing camera to allow for slo-mo videos (dubbed “selfies by Apple…), as well as landscape videos and selfies.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 11 also boasts better battery time than its predecessors, with Apple claiming it will last an additional hour.</p>\\n<p>The base model of the iPhone 11 has 64GB of internal memory, but it is also available in 128GB and 256GB models. The 64GB phone will be released for $699, whereas the 128GB and 256GB\\xa0 phones started at $749 respectively. You will be able to choose between six different colors: white, black, green, yellow, purple, and PRODUCT(RED).</p>\\n<p>The phone was announced on September 10, 2019, made available for pre-order on September 13, 2019, and shipped/sold in stores on September 20, 2019.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 15.2: iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max</h2>\\n<p>In addition to the iPhone 11, Apple also announced on September 10, 2019, the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Like the iPhone 11, this iPhone has an updated processor (A13 Bionic) and a longer battery life, although the iPhone Pro and Pro Max are designed to last an additional four hours and five hours more than the iPhone XS and XS Max respectively.</p>\\n<p>Like the XS and XS Max, the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max have an OLED Super Retina display whereas the basic iPhone 11 has an LCD Liquid Crystal display that has less resolution.</p>\\n<p>However, hands-down the biggest difference between the iPhone Pro/Pro Max and the iPhone 11 is the camera. For the first time in iPhone history, an iPhone will have three cameras on the back of it, one of which is a telephoto lens and one of which is an ultra-wide-angle.</p>\\n<p>This just shows how much Apple understands the importance of a good camera in a phone. We live in an Instagram era, folks.</p>\\n<p>But this camera is for more than just social media. It’s designed to help people take professional-grade photos and videos with their phones, and specific apps will be released to help people do this. One example presented by Apple is deep fusion, which takes nine photos using the three lenses almost at once, and then processes these images to find the best version of your subject. Pretty cool stuff.</p>\\n<p>Internally, the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max are the same. The only difference is the size. Following the XS and XS Max, The iPhone 11 Pro has a 5.8-inch screen and the Pro Max has a 6.5-inch screen.</p>\\n<p>Like the iPhone 11, the base Pro models come with 64GB storage, but you can upgrade to either 256GB or 512MB. The Pro models come in just four colors: Spacy Gray, Midnight Green, Silver, and Gold.</p>\\n<p>For the Pro model, the pricing is as follows:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>64GB – $999</li>\\n<li>256GB – $1149</li>\\n<li>512GB – $1349</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>And for the Pro Max model, the prices on release were:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>64GB – $1099</li>\\n<li>256GB – $1249</li>\\n<li>512GB – $1449</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Generation 16.1: iPhone 12 and 12 Mini</h2>\\n<p>Although 2020 was a crazy year for many reasons, mainly because of the Coronavirus pandemic, some things stayed the same, such as Apple releasing a new iPhone. This generation of iPhones, known collectively as the iPhone 12, marked a new era in the history of the iPhone.</p>\\n<h3>When Did the iPhone 12 Come Out?</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone 12 was released on June 22, 2020, at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro began on October 16, 2020, and hit stores on October 23, 2020. For the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone Pro Max, pre-orders started on November 6, 2020, and they hit stores on November 16, 2020.</p>\\n<p>The event was an online presentation conducted from its headquarters in Apple Park (the first online presentation in the history of the WWDC events) and was <a>streamed live to an audience of about 1.2 million people</a> on <a>YouTube</a>.</p>\\n<h3>New Features of the iPhone 12</h3>\\n<p>As the latest model of iPhone at the time, the iPhone 12 features several upgrades as compared to the iPhone 11, such as:</p>\\n<h4>Design</h4>\\n<p>The iPhone 12’s design seems to hark back to the earlier models in the device lineup, specifically the iPhone 4, with flat edges and thinner bezels that <a>Apple claims make the device more durable compared to previous generations</a>. This is a major departure from the rounded design used since the iPhone 6.</p>\\n<p>The front and back ceramic glass panels are bound by an aluminum frame in the iPhone 12 and 12 mini, while the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max have a stainless steel frame. The speaker and the TrueDepth Camera are housed in a notch in the top section of the screen. The U.S. models of the iPhone 12 have a new 5G mmWave antenna. This feature will only be made for the iPhone 12’s U.S. market.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 12 mini is 5.18 inches tall, 2.53 inches wide, and 0.29 thick while the iPhone 12 is 5.78 inches tall, 2.82 inches wide (71.5mm), and 0.29 inches thick. iPhone 12 models can withstand rain, splashes, and accidental spills thanks to the IP68 water resistance rating. In the IP68 number, the 6 refers to dust resistance (and means the iPhone 12 Pro can hold up to dirt, dust, and other particulates), while the 8 pertains to water resistance. IP6x is the highest dust resistance rating in existence.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 12 and 12 mini are available in red, black, white, green, and blue. Like the iPhone 12, the 12 mini has 4GB of RAM and comes in 64GB,128GB, and 256GB storage sizes. All features on these two devices are similar except for the size and weight. The mini weighs in at 4.76 ounces (135 grams) while the iPhone 12 is 5.78 ounces (164 grams) heavy.</p>\\n<h4>Battery Life</h4>\\n<p>The major issue that users might have with the iPhone 12 mini is battery life. Being a smaller device compared to the previous versions, the battery is smaller to fit in the compact design. However, Apple claims that compared to the iPhone 12, the 12 mini can get 10 rather than 11 hours of streaming, and 50 rather than 65 hours of audio playback on a charge. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini support fast charging and can charge to 50 percent within 30 minutes using a Lightning to USB-C cable and a 20W power adapter.</p>\\n<h4>Display</h4>\\n<p>Screenwise, the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini spot a 6.1-inch and a 5.4-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display respectively. This is an improvement over the iPhone 11’s Liquid Retina IPS LCD display as the XDR display in the iPhone 12 provides a High Dynamic Range that delivers a broad range of dark and light areas in photos and video. There’s a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio for blacker blacks and brighter whites, and up to 1200 nits peak brightness for HDR photos, videos, TV shows, and movies. Typical max brightness is 625 nits on the iPhone 12 models.</p>\\n<p>This, coupled with OLED technology, gives the iPhone 12 a much crisper picture experience and better viewing angles than any previous generation of iPhone. Apple also incorporated <a>Dolby Vision</a> and <a>True-Tone technology</a> in the iPhone 12’s display. All iPhone 12 models have nano-ceramic crystals infused in the scratch-resistant glass fascia. This means the device has 4 times better fall resistance compared to the iPhone 11.</p>\\n<h4>Processor and Operating System</h4>\\n<p>The iPhone 12 has a new 5 Nanometer Apple A14 Bionic chipset. This 5nm chipset has 11.5 billion transistors, that’s 3 billion more than its predecessor. A higher <a>transistor</a> count translates to a 15% increase in performance and 30% more power efficiency. The GPU in the A14 chip also offers improved graphics performance for up to 8.3% more than the A13 chip released with the iPhone 11 in 2019.</p>\\n<p>All iPhone 12 models run on iOS 14, the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system. iOS 14 is Apple’s biggest iOS update to date, introducing home screen design changes, major new features, Siri improvements, updates for existing apps, and many other tweaks that streamline the iOS interface.</p>\\n<h4>Wireless Charging</h4>\\n<p>Apple has also brought back the MagSafe charging technology. MagSafe utilizes a ring of magnets in all the \\u200ciPhone 12\\u200c models to connect to accessories that also have magnets built inside.</p>\\n<p>This means a MagSafe Charger snaps onto the back of an iPhone, much like a magnet snaps onto a <a>refrigerator</a>. The design of the magnet ring allows all \\u200ciPhone 12\\u200c models to be compatible with a wide range of accessories that rely on magnets, from chargers to mounts to cases.</p>\\n<p>All iPhone 12 models also maintain Face ID for biometric identification. The Face ID components are housed in the TrueDepth camera system in the display notch.</p>\\n<p>In addition to powering facial recognition, the 12-megapixel f/2.2 camera in the TrueDepth camera system is also a front-facing selfie/FaceTime camera with many of the same features that are available for the rear-facing camera.</p>\\n<h4>Cameras</h4>\\n<p>As for the rear camera, both the iPhone 12 and 12 mini spot a dual 12MP camera system: Ultra Wide and Wide cameras. The Ultra-Wide camera has a f/2.4 aperture, a 120-degree field of view, and a 13mm focal length, which is ideal for landscape shots and unique, artistic shots with a super wide-angle field of view.</p>\\n<p>The Wide camera comes with a 26mm focal length and an f/1.6 aperture that lets in 27 percent more light than the f/1.8 aperture in the iPhone 11 camera.</p>\\n<p>Since both the iPhone 12 and 12 mini lack a telephoto lens, they only support 5x digital zoom and 2x optical zoom out (with the Ultra Wide lens) but no optical zoom in.</p>\\n<h4>5G Capability</h4>\\n<p>This was the first iPhone to fully support 5G Networks. All iPhone 12 models support the two types of 5G networks: <a>mmWave and Sub-6GHz 5G</a>. As for Bluetooth and WiFi, all the iPhone 12 models support Bluetooth 5.0 and WiFi 6, the newest and fastest WiFi protocol.</p>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>Who Invented WiFi? Internet in the Air</a></p>\\n<h4>Materials</h4>\\n<p>In an effort to limit its environmental impact, Apple has eliminated the power adapter or EarPods in the iPhone 12 and 12 mini’s packaging. The new iPhones ship in a smaller, slimmer box and come with just a standard USB-C to Lightning cable.</p>\\n<h3>iPhone 12 Controversy</h3>\\n<p>The move by Apple to eliminate the power adapter from the iPhone 12’s packaging (for environmental reasons – as Apple claims) has received quite a bit of blowback from around the world.</p>\\n<p>On 2nd December 2020, Procon-SP, a Brazilian consumer protection agency based in Sao Paolo, <a>released a statement on its website</a> asking Apple to verify the real and specific advantages that not including the iPhone 12 charger represents for the environment and how this action affects the environment in a ‘positive’ way.</p>\\n<p>Apple responded to the request and claimed that by removing the charger from the packaging, the company was cutting back on carbon emissions produced especially when mining for precious materials that are used in the development of the chargers.</p>\\n<p>However, Proton-SP was not satisfied by this response and claimed that Apple has no action on a possible application of reverse logistics for the collection of old devices and adapters for recycling and proper disposal, which would impact the protection of the environment.</p>\\n<p>“When failing to sell the product without the charger, claiming carbon reduction and environmental protection, the company should present a recycling project. Procon-SP will demand that Apple present a viable plan, added Fernando Capez, executive director of Procon-SP.</p>\\n<p>Apple’s conduct is still under review by Procon-SP and if there are any violations of the law, the company may be fined as stipulated in the Consumer Protection and Defense Code. This could mean that iPhone 12 users in Brazil might have the charger included when purchasing their devices in the coming months.</p>\\n<p>There have also been reports by users of a much higher battery drain rate than expected. Users have been complaining in the <a>Apple forums</a> about the iPhone 12 (especially the Pro models) draining battery power by 20-40% while on standby.</p>\\n<p>A majority of complainants are also pointing out that it’s a huge dip compared to the iPhone 11 Pro even when they were expecting a drop in battery life due to the inclusion of 5G alongside more powerful hardware. Apple has yet to address this issue.</p>\\n<p>Similarly, another group of users on the <a>Apple</a> forums complained about signal loss on their new iPhone 12 devices. As per the users, many of them see a drop in the network just after a few minutes of usage.</p>\\n<p>The issue is most prominent while driving or traveling. The problem is present in all the iPhone 12 models, as the phone drops network connectivity either 5G or LTE in the areas with good network reception. There are threads on <a>Reddit</a>, concerning the same issue reported by multiple users worldwide. Indian users are also affected by this issue on their 4G networks.</p>\\n<p>However, most users are hoping that the signal and battery issues are software-related and that Apple could fix the problem with the next iOS update.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 16.2: iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max</h2>\\n<p>Alongside the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini, Apple also introduced the higher-end versions of the device, the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. The major difference between these two devices is camera technology.</p>\\n<h4>Camera</h4>\\n<p>The Pro also incorporates Apple ProRaw Capture gives the user access to more image data so you can get a head start on editing, with noise reduction and multi-frame exposure adjustments already in place — and have more time to tweak color and white balance.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 12 Pro’s camera also incorporates 4K HDR Dolby Vision offering a cinematic look in video scenes with stronger contrasts for up to 60 fps.</p>\\n<h4>Designed for Pros</h4>\\n<p>These two devices are great assets to more ‘camera-centric’ individuals like content creators and photographers who are willing to pay more for better camera features.</p>\\n<p>For the average user, who takes a normal selfie, the base versions of the iPhone 12 should offer adequate camera features if not better than other smartphones in this niche market.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone Pro Max has all the features of the iPhone 12 Pro, plus a wide-angle camera with a 47% larger sensor. Giving the sensor sites more room and making them larger makes them more sensitive to light. More light means more signal, less noise, and sharper results.</p>\\n<p>The Pro Max also has a sensor shift on the wide-angle camera that assists in image stabilization, especially in high exposure photography, and a 65mm telephoto focal length lens that offers a 5x total optical zoom range. The iPhone 12 Pro Max’s camera offers users, especially professional photographers, more tools and functionality to nail that perfect shot.</p>\\n<h4>Display and Storage</h4>\\n<p>In addition to the upgraded camera technology, the Pro Max also has a 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display, making the device the largest in iPhone history.</p>\\n<p>Both devices have the 512GB internal storage option, which is 256GB more than is available with the base and mini versions.\\xa0 This is plenty of storage to accommodate the RAW image files from their advanced camera setup.</p>\\n<h4>Price</h4>\\n<p>The iPhone 12 retails at $799. The mini version starts at $699, while the Pro and Pro Max versions retail at $999 and $1,099 respectively. Compared to other smartphones in this market segment, for example, the Huawei P40 Pro Plus ($1,159), Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra ($1,049), and Google Pixel 5 ($829).</p>\\n<p>READ MORE: <a>Who Invented Google? The Story Behind The Search Engine</a></p>\\n<p>The iPhone 12 base and mini versions are a bit affordable, but for users who are willing to throw in a few extra bucks for that camera magic, the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max offer greater camera performance and functionality than their Android competitors.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 16.3: The iPhone SE (Mk. 2)</h2>\\n<p>In 2020, Apple also brought back the iPhone SE after a 2-year hiatus. The original iPhone SE (which resembled the iPhone 5) came out in 2016 and was a low-cost alternative to the iPhone 7 that came out the same year. The brand was however discontinued in 2018.</p>\\n<h3>When Did the Second iPhone SE Come Out?</h3>\\n<p>Apple revived the name “SE” and announced the second iPhone SE on April 15, 2020. Pre-orders began on April 17, 2020, and the phone was officially released on April 24, 2020.</p>\\n<p>It was a new 4.7-inch device that looked like an iPhone 8 with features similar to those of the iPhone 11.</p>\\n<p>Available in red, black, and white, the new iPhone SE has a front and back glass cover and a color-matching aluminum frame in the middle. Like its counterpart from 2016, the iPhone SE comes at a budget retail price. The SE is available in three internal memory configurations; 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. All iPhone SE versions have 3GB of RAM.</p>\\n<p>This device is aimed at users who want top-notch performance from an iPhone but feel like the flagship iPhone 12’s price is too steep.</p>\\n<p>Since the iPhone SE is physically identical to the iPhone 8, it continues to feature thick top and bottom bezels. The top bezel accommodates the 7-megapixel front-facing camera and microphone while the bottom bezel includes a Touch ID Home button that’s also a fingerprint reader.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone SE is the only iPhone in Apple’s current lineup that features Touch ID over Face ID. Like other iPhones, it still uses Haptic Touch for Quick Actions and contextual menus, with 3D Touch, which is currently removed from the iPhone 12 models.</p>\\n<p>The device comes with a 4.7-inch Retina HD LCD display with True Tone to match the ambient lighting in a room, a wide color gamut, Dolby Vision, and HDR10. Unlike the iPhone 12 which has a ceramic-induced glass cover, the iPhone SE’s front glass panel is made from ion-strengthened glass with an oleophobic coating that is fingerprint resistant.</p>\\n<p>At the back, the iPhone SE sports a single-lens 12-megapixel rear camera with an f/1.8 aperture, optical image stabilization, and support for Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting. However, unlike its flagship siblings, it doesn’t incorporate the night portrait mode so pictures taken at night will be quite dark in comparison.</p>\\n<p>For night-time photography, the iPhone SE will be assisted by a TrueTone LED Flash with Slow Sync capabilities, smart high dynamic range, and wide color support. The iPhone SE’s camera can record 4K video at up to 60 frames per second with optical image stabilization and support for slow-motion video and time-lapse video.</p>\\n<p>For the operating system, the iPhone SE originally ran on iOS 13 but later on, Apple upgraded it to the new iOS 14. The software is powered by the same A13 Bionic chip that was used on the iPhone 11.</p>\\n<p>The A13 Bionic has a dedicated 8-core neural engine that can perform 5 trillion operations per second, two Machine Learning Accelerators on the CPU, and a Machine Learning Controller for better performance and efficiency. Despite it being more than a year old, Apple’s A13 chip is a very capable processor and when paired with 3GB of RAM, the device is capable of keeping up with other mid-range phones in its price bracket.</p>\\n<p>As for battery life, the iPhone SE can last for 13 hours when watching videos, eight hours when streaming videos, and 40 hours when listening to audio. It is capable of fast charging and can charge up to 50 percent in 30 minutes when using an 18W power adapter or higher. Wireless charging is also supported.</p>\\n<p>The 2020 iPhone SE is also dust, splash, and water-resistant with an IP67 rating meaning that it can withstand a depth of 1 meter for 30 minutes.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone SE is 5G capable and has support for WiFi 6 along with Bluetooth 5 and Gigabit-class LTE with 2×2 MIMO. It also has NFC with reader mode and supports Express Cards (transit cards) with a power reserve feature that allows cards to be accessible even when the battery is dead.</p>\\n<p>Price-wise, the 64GB version of the iPhone SE is priced at $399, the 128GB model is priced at\\xa0 $449 and the 264GB model sells for $549.</p>\\n<h2>Generation 17.1: iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini</h2>\\n<p>Just a little more than one year after the release of the iPhone 12, Apple introduced the next model in its long line of iPhone generations: the iPhone 13, which has four total variations: the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p>\\n<h3>When Was the iPhone 13 Released?</h3>\\n<p>The iPhone 13 was announced on September 14, 2021. Pre-orders started on September 17, 2021, and the device became available starting on September 24, 2021.</p>\\n<h3>New Features of the iPhone 13</h3>\\n<p>Like the iPhone 12, the iPhone 13 comes equipped with 5G capabilities, though iPhone 13 users will be able to access even faster speeds. The iPhone 13 also mimics the design of the iPhone 12 with a flat-edge display and an aluminum frame.</p>\\n<p>But one year after the release of the iPhone 12, here’s what’s changed in the new model:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Longer battery life</strong> –Thanks to an improved processor, better components, and a better integration of hardware and software, the iPhone 13 has a considerably longer battery life than the iPhone 12. Specifically, the iPhone 13 lasts about 2.5 hours longer than the iPhone 12, and the iPhone 13 Mini lasts around 1.5 hours longer than the iPhone 12 mini.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Improved camera</strong> – The two cameras on the back of the iPhone 13 are diagonally arranged to enable Apple’s signature dual-camera system. This allows the iPhone 13 to capture up to 47 percent more light, and enhanced image stabilization technology allows the iPhone 13 to capture more detail in darker areas.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Professional video recording</strong> – The iPhone 13 comes with what is known as “Cinematic mode.” This incorporates technologies, such as automatic focus changes, to allow users to shoot cinema-quality videos even if they aren’t professionals. In addition, the iPhone 13 captures videos in such a way that allows for advanced editing in iMovie, which makes it easier for users to produce professionally finished products.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>iOS 14 and A15 Processor</strong> – As is usually the case, Apple has updated both the phone’s operating system (iOS) and processor. This makes the iPhone 13 the fastest iPhone on the market and makes possible features such as portrait-mode FaceTime calls, augmented reality, and 3D maps, and it also introduces new security and privacy controls.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Recycled materials</strong> – In line with Apple’s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030, the iPhone 13 includes several recycled materials, such as antenna lines made from upcycled plastic water bottles, 100 percent recycled magnets and gold, and less plastic wrap in the packaging.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Generation 17.2: iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max</h2>\\n<p>Just like it did in 2020, when Apple released the iPhone 13 in 2021 it came out with two different versions: iPhone 13/iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13 Pro/iPhone Pro Max</p>\\n<p>The two are very similar, but there are a few key differences, mainly:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Screen size</strong> – the iPhone 13 Pro Max has a 6.7″ Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion. The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1″ Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion, whereas the standard iPhone 13 has a 6.1″ display without ProMotion. The iPhone 13 Mini has a 5.4″ display.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Cameras</strong> – The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max both have three cameras and a telephoto lens alongside the wide lens. They also have a 6x Optical zoom range as opposed to just 2x on the standard iPhone 13</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Battery life</strong> – The iPhone 13 Pro Max has a battery life of 28 hours, the iPhone 13 Pro has a 22-hour lifespan, the iPhone 13 lasts for 19 hours, and the iPhone 13 mini lasts for around 17 hours.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Capacity</strong> – All iPhone 13 models have capacity options of 128GB, 256GB, and 512 GB, but the Pro and Pro Max also have 1TB options. </li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Price</strong>– The iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at $1099, the iPhone Pro starts at $999, and the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini retail at $799 and $699 respectively.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Generation 18: iPhone 14, 14 Plus, 14 Pro, 14 Pro Max</h2>\\n<p>Almost one year to the date after the release of the iPhone 13, Apple announced the newest version of the iPhone, the iPhone 14. Technically the 18th generation of this landmark phone, not a whole lot changed between 2021 and 2022.</p>\\n<p>One big thing Apple did with the release of the iPhone 14 is get rid of the Mini. For the previous two years, Apple experimented with smaller devices, but poor sales suggested people wanted bigger screens so Apple had stopped, for now, releasing this version of its device.</p>\\n<h3>When Was the iPhone 14 Released?</h3>\\n<p>Apple announced the release of the new iPhone 14 on September 7, 2022. Pre-order sales began on September 9, 2022, and the phone first became available on September 17, 2022.</p>\\n<h3>New Features of the iPhone 14</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Better front and rear cameras</strong> – As always, a big focus of Apple’s new device was the camera. On the iPhone 14, both the front and back cameras got an upgrade, improving the quality of selfies and also making it easier to take high-quality photos in low light.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Dynamic Island</strong> – No, this is not a reality TV show, but rather the most exciting feature of the iPhone 14 as compared to the iPhone 13. This display bar fits over the selfie camera on the front of the screen and makes this space useful, instead of just making a hole in the display. You can change settings, and get useful information such as time and battery use, and other things on this dynamic bit of hardware that adds function to a previously underused part of the phone.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Enhanced emergency features</strong> –Our phones are a big lifeline for us in the event of an emergency. Apple took this into consideration when building the new iPhone 14 by including features such as Crash Detection. Using motion sensors and other built-in technology, the phone will be able to automatically detect when you’ve been in a car accident and can contact emergency services for you.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Improved display brightness</strong> – Only relevant to the Plus, Pro, and Pro Max, the iPhone 14 features the brightest screen in the iPhone lineup, which is Apple’s response to the reality that more and more people are using their phones to consume digital media.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Storage</strong>– The iPhone 14 is available with either 256 or 512 GB of internal memory, in addition to available iCloud storage.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Generation 19: iPhone 15</h2>\\n<p>In September 2023, Apple unveiled the much-anticipated iPhone 15 series at its annual event, which was held both in-person and virtually. This event marked a return to more traditional, pre-pandemic presentation formats, while also retaining the digital accessibility that had become popular over the previous years. The iPhone 15 series was officially released to the public in late September 2023.</p>\\n<h3>New Features of the iPhone 15</h3>\\n<p>Apple’s iPhone 15 series, introduced in September 2023, marks another significant step in the evolution of the iPhone. Building on the innovations of previous models, the iPhone 15 series comes with a range of new features and enhancements that solidify its position as a leader in the smartphone market.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Design and Display</strong> – The iPhone 15 retains the sleek design language of its predecessors, with some subtle yet impactful tweaks. The bezels are further reduced, providing an even more immersive edge-to-edge display experience. The Pro models feature a new, advanced Super Retina XDR display, offering higher brightness levels and improved color accuracy. The standard iPhone 15 models also see a bump in display quality, with enhanced HDR capabilities.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Camera System</strong> – The camera system on the iPhone 15 series receives significant upgrades. The Pro models now feature a quad-camera setup, including a new sensor that dramatically improves low-light photography and videography. The standard models are equipped with a triple-camera system, including a new telephoto lens that offers better zoom capabilities and depth sensing for portrait shots. Apple introduced a new image processing algorithm that enhances photo clarity and color reproduction, making the iPhone 15’s camera one of the most advanced in the smartphone market.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Processor and Performance</strong> – Powering the iPhone 15 is the new A17 Bionic chip, which offers faster performance and greater efficiency. This results in smoother operation, quicker app loading times, and enhanced gaming experiences. The A17 chip also brings improvements in machine learning and AI tasks, enhancing features like Siri, facial recognition, and augmented reality applications.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Battery Life and Charging</strong> – The iPhone 15 series sees an improvement in battery life, thanks to the more efficient A17 chip and larger battery capacities. Apple introduces a new, faster wireless charging technology that significantly reduces the time needed to fully charge the device.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Software and Connectivity</strong> – The iPhone 15 runs on iOS 17, which introduces new customization options, enhanced privacy features, and seamless integration with other Apple products. The series supports the latest Wi-Fi 6E and 5G standards, ensuring faster internet speeds and more reliable connectivity.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Environmental Initiatives</strong> – Continuing its commitment to the environment, Apple has increased the use of recycled materials in the iPhone 15’s construction. The packaging is further reduced and now completely eliminates single-use plastics.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Models</strong> – The iPhone 15 series is available in four models: the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Mini, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Each model is available in multiple storage options, starting from 128GB to 1TB for the Pro models. The iPhone 15 series is available in new color options, including a striking new midnight blue and a refreshed rose gold, alongside the classic space gray, silver, and gold.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>With the iPhone 15 series, Apple continues to push the boundaries of smartphone technology. The combination of cutting-edge hardware, sophisticated software, and a focus on environmental sustainability makes the iPhone 15 a compelling choice for consumers seeking the latest in mobile innovation.</p>\\n<h2>The Next Chapter in iPhone History</h2>\\n<p>If history tells us anything, then the next chapter of iPhone history should begin in the fall of 2021. However, we won’t really know for sure what this will mean until it happens.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Will Apple simply come out with an updated version of its latest device?</li>\\n<li>Will they break the mold and come out with something truly groundbreaking?</li>\\n<li>Will they finally find a way to prevent people from working out <a>how to unlock their iPhones</a>?</li>\\n<li>Will they once again remove the iOS exploits used to jailbreak their iPhones?</li>\\n<li>Is the 4 lens camera just hype or is it the real deal?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Only time will tell, but the one thing we know for sure is that the history of the iPhone is far from over.</p>\\n<p><strong>READ MORE</strong>: <a>The History of Marketing</a></p>\\n<div>\\n<div><a><span><span><span><span>Share</span></span></span></span></a></div>\\n<div><a><span><span><span><span>Tweet</span></span></span></span></a></div>\\n<div><a><span><span><span><span>Reddit</span></span></span></span></a></div>\\n<div><a><span><span><span><span>Pin</span></span></span></span></a></div>\\n<div><a><span><span><span><span>Email</span></span></span></span></a></div>\\n</div> </div>\\n<div>\\n<h3>How to Cite this Article</h3>\\n<p>There are three different ways you can cite this article.</p>\\n<p>1.

Thank you. Most iPhone histories miss on the key aspects about the iPhone architecture and strategy that eviscerated the carriers. Namely by maintaining control of the OS and agnosticity with respect to internet access (2/3/4G or wifi for any app) they removed the carriers from having any control over what happened above layer 2 in the informational stack. Verizon knew this would happen and believed it’s better 2G and quickly evolving 3G network would allow it to maintain control over its silo. Cingular (AT&amp;T) who had challenges with coverage and throughput of its 2G network had to cave to Jobs’ demands about OS autonomy wrt access.</p>\\n<span><a>Reply</a></span> </div></article></li>\\n<li><article><footer><div>\\n<div>\\n<cite>Tolga Bağcı</cite> </div>\\n<div>\\n<a> <time>May 29, 2019 at 9:40 pm</time></a> </div>\\n</div></footer><div>\\n<p>This is a great post.

That, and actual Voicemail-to-text was a feature that had been experimented with before (I believe Google pioneered the VM-to-text feature, actually), thru their now discontinued online phone services – but only more recently added to iOS, iirc. I remember getting VM sent to me as SMS text using this Google feature quite some time before the iPhone or Android devices were even out, as well as ‘visual voicemail’, albeit without a touchscreen (maybe on my Blackberry, or that T-Mobile exclusive phone where the screen flipped up and showed a keyboard… I forget the model.). I’m sure if you dig you can verify almost all of this. I might be a little fuzzy on details, but I’m sure this is a fairly accurate recount of things.</p>\\n<span><a>Reply</a></span> </div></article></li>\\n<li><article><footer><div>\\n<div>\\n<cite>John Maynor</cite> </div>\\n<div>\\n<a> <time>July 25, 2019 at 3:30 am</time></a> </div>\\n</div></footer><div>\\n<p>Would I be able to find out who the author is (if there is one) and when this was originally posted.

Ahead of that anniversary,</em>Motherboard<em>editor Brian Merchant embarked on an investigation to uncover the iPhone’s untold origin.</em><a>The One Device: The secret history of the iPhone</a>,<em>out on June 20th, traces that journey from Kenyan mines to Chinese factories all the way to One Infinite Loop. The following excerpt has been lightly condensed and edited.</em></p></div>\\n<div><p>If you worked at Apple in the mid-2000s, you might have noticed a strange phenomenon afoot: people were disappearing.</p></div>\\n<div><p>It happened slowly at first. One day there’d be an empty chair where a star engineer used to sit. A key member of the team, gone. Nobody could tell you exactly where they went.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“I had been hearing rumblings about, well, it was unclear what was being built, but it was clear that a lot of the best engineers from the best teams had been slurped over to this mysterious team,” says Evan Doll, who was then a software engineer at Apple.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Here’s what was happening to those star engineers. First, a couple of managers had shown up in their office unannounced and closed the door behind them. Managers like Henri Lamiraux, a director of software engineering, and Richard Williamson, a director of software.</p></div>\\n<div><p>One such star engineer was Andre Boule. He’d been at the company only a few months.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“Henri and I walked into his office,” Williamson recalls, “and we said, ‘Andre, you don’t really know us, but we’ve heard a lot about you, and we know you’re a brilliant engineer, and we want you to come work with us on a project we can’t tell you about. And we want you to do it now. Today.’ ”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Boule was incredulous, then suspicious. “Andre said, ‘Can I have some time to think about it?’ ” Williamson says. “And we said, ‘No.’ ” They wouldn’t, and couldn’t, give him any more details. Still, by the end of the day, Boule had signed on. “We did that again and again across the company,” Williamson says. Some engineers who liked their jobs just fine said no, and they stayed in Cupertino. Those who said yes, like Boule, went to work on the iPhone.</p></div>\\n<div><p>And their lives would never be the same — at least, not for the next two and a half years. Not only would they be working overtime to hammer together the most influential piece of consumer technology of their generation, but they’d be doing little else. Their personal lives would disappear, and they wouldn’t be able to talk about what they were working on. Steve Jobs “didn’t want anyone to leak it if they left the company,” says Tony Fadell, one of the top Apple executives who helped build the iPhone. “He didn’t want anyone to say anything. He just didn’t want — he was just naturally paranoid.”</p></div>\\n<div><div>\\n<div>\\n<h2>More on The One Device  /</h2>\\n<p>Hear Nilay Patel interview Brian Merchant about the reporting behind The One Device on a special episode of the Vergecast.</p>\\n</div>\\n<a>Listen here</a>\\n</div></div>\\n<div><p>Jobs told Scott Forstall, who would become the head of the iPhone software division, that even he couldn’t breathe a word about the phone to anyone, inside Apple or out, who wasn’t on the team. “He didn’t want, for secrecy reasons, for me to hire anyone outside of Apple to work on the user interface,” Forstall said. “But he told me I could move anyone in the company into this team.” So he dispatched managers like Henri and Richard to find the best candidates. And he made sure potential recruits knew the stakes upfront. “We’re starting a new project,” he told them. “It’s so secret, I can’t even tell you what that new project is. I cannot tell you who you will work for. What I can tell you is if you choose to accept this role, you’re going to work harder than you ever have in your entire life. You’re going to have to give up nights and weekends probably for a couple years as we make this product.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>And “amazingly,” as Forstall put it, some of the top talent at the company signed on. “Honestly, everyone there was brilliant,” Williamson tells me. That team — veteran designers, rising programmers, managers who’d worked with Jobs for years, engineers who’d never met him — would end up becoming one of the great, unheralded creative forces of the twenty-first century.</p></div>\\n<div><p>One of Apple’s greatest strengths is that it makes its technology look and feel easy to use. There was nothing easy about making the iPhone, though its inventors say the process was often exhilarating.</p></div>\\n<div><div><p>“The iPhone is the reason I’m divorced.”</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>Forstall’s prediction to the iPhone team would be borne out.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“The iPhone is the reason I’m divorced,” Andy Grignon, a senior iPhone engineer, tells me. I heard that sentiment more than once throughout my dozens of interviews with the iPhone’s key architects and engineers. “Yeah, the iPhone ruined more than a few marriages,” says another.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“It was really intense, probably professionally one of the worst times of my life,” Grignon says. “Because you created a pressure cooker of a bunch of really smart people with an impossible deadline, an impossible mission, and then you hear that the future of the entire company is resting on it. So it was just like this soup of misery,” Grignon says. “There wasn’t really time to kick your feet back on the desk and say, ‘This is going to be really fucking awesome one day.’ It was like, ‘Holy fuck, we’re fucked.’ Every time you turned around there was some just imminent demise of the program just lurking around the corner.”</p></div>\\n<div><h2><strong>Making the iPhone</strong></h2></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone began as a Steve Jobs–approved project at Apple around the end of 2004. But its DNA began coiling long before that.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“I think a lot of people look at the form factor and they think it’s not just like any other computer, but it is — it’s just like any other computer,” Williamson says. “In fact, it’s <em>more</em> complex, in terms of software, than many other computers. The operating system on this is as sophisticated as the operating system on any modern computer. But it is an evolution of the operating system we’ve been developing over the last thirty years.”</p></div>\\n<div><div><div><figcaption><em>Alternative iPhone prototype.</em></figcaption></div></div></div>\\n<div><p>Like many mass-adopted, highly profitable technologies, the iPhone has a number of competing origin stories. There were as many as five different phone or phone-related projects — from tiny research endeavors to full-blown corporate partnerships — bubbling up at Apple by the middle of the 2000s. But if there’s anything I’ve learned in my efforts to pull the iPhone apart, literally and figuratively, it’s that there are rarely concrete beginnings to any particular products or technologies — they evolve from varying previous ideas and concepts and inventions and are prodded and iterated into newness by restless minds and profit motives. Even when the company’s executives were under oath in a federal trial, they couldn’t name just one starting place.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“There were many things that led to the development of the iPhone at Apple,” Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said in 2012. “First, Apple had been known for years for being the creator of the Mac, the computer, and it was great, but it had small market share,” he said. “And then we had a big hit called the iPod. It was the iPod hardware and the iTunes software. And this really changed everybody’s view of Apple, both inside and outside the company. And people started asking, Well, if you can have a big hit with the iPod, what else can you do? And people were suggesting every idea, make a camera, make a car, crazy stuff.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>And make a phone, of course.</p></div>\\n<div><h2><strong>Open the Pod Bay Doors</strong></h2></div>\\n<div><p>When Steve Jobs returned to take the helm of a flailing Apple in 1997, he garnered acclaim and earned a slim profit by slashing product lines and getting the Mac business back on track. But Apple didn’t reemerge as a major cultural and economic force until it released the iPod, which would mark its first profitable entry into consumer electronics and become a blueprint and a springboard for the iPhone in the process.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“There would be no iPhone without the iPod,” says Tony Fadell, who helped build both of them. Fadell, sometimes dubbed “the Podfather” by the media, was a driving force in creating Apple’s first bona fide hit device in years, and he’d oversee hardware development for the iPhone. As such, there are few better people to explain the bridge between the two hit devices. We met at Brasserie Thoumieux, a swank eatery in Paris’s gilded seventh arrondissement, where he was living at the time.</p></div>\\n<div><div><p>He’s been called “Tony Baloney,” and one former Apple exec advised me “not to believe a single word Tony Fadell says.”</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>Fadell is a looming figure in modern Silicon Valley lore, and he’s divisive in the annals of Apple. Brian Huppi and Joshua Strickon, key members of Apple’s input engineering team, who’d prototyped the earliest drafts of the iPhone, praise him for his audacious, get-it-done management style (“Don’t take longer than a year to ship a product” is one of his credos) and for being one of the few people strong enough of will to stand up to Steve Jobs. Others chafe at the credit he takes for his role in bringing the iPod and iPhone to market; he’s been called “Tony Baloney,” and one former Apple exec advised me “not to believe a single word Tony Fadell says.” After he left Apple in 2008, he co-founded Nest, a company that crafted smart home gadgets, like learning thermostats, which was later acquired by Google for $3.2 billion.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Right on time, Fadell strode in; shaved head save for some stubble, icy blue eyes, snug sweater. He was once renowned for his cyberpunk style, his rebellious streak, and a fiery temper that was often compared to Jobs’s. Fadell is still undeniably intense, but here, speaking easy French to the waitstaff, he was smack in the overlap of a Venn diagram showing Mannered Parisian Elite and Brash Tech Titan.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“The genesis of the iPhone, was — well, let’s get started with — was iPod dominance,” Fadell says. “It was fifty percent of Apple’s revenue.” But when iPods initially shipped in 2001, hardly anyone noticed them. “It took two years,” Fadell says. “It was only made for the Mac. It was less than one percent market share in the U.S. They like to say ‘low single digits.’ ” Consumers needed iTunes software to load and manage the songs and playlists, and that software ran only on Macs.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“Over my dead body are you gonna ship iTunes on a PC,” Steve Jobs told Fadell, he says, when Fadell pushed the idea of offering iTunes on Windows. Nonetheless, Fadell had a team secretly building out the software to make iTunes compatible with Windows. “It took two years of failing numbers before Steve finally woke up. Then we started to take off, then the music store was able to be a success.” That success put iPods in the hands of hundreds of millions of people— more than had ever owned Macs. Moreover, the iPod was hip in a fashionably mainstream way that lent a patina of cool to Apple as a whole. Fadell rose in the executive ranks and oversaw the new product division.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Launched in 2001, a hit by 2003, the iPod was deemed vulnerable as early as 2004. The mobile phone was seen as a threat because it could play MP3s. “So if you could only carry one device, which one would you have to choose?” Fadell says. “And that’s why the Motorola Rokr happened.”</p></div>\\n<div><h2><strong>Rokring Out</strong></h2></div>\\n<div><p>In 2004, Motorola was manufacturing one of the most popular phones on the market, the ultrathin Razr flip phone. Its new CEO, Ed Zander, was friendly with Jobs, who liked the Razr’s design, and the two set about exploring how Apple and Motorola might collaborate. (In 2003, Apple execs had considered buying Motorola outright but decided it’d be too expensive.) Thus the “iTunes phone” was born. Apple and Motorola partnered with the wireless carrier Cingular, and the Rokr was announced that summer.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Publicly, Jobs had been resistant to the idea of Apple making a phone. “The problem with a phone,” Steve Jobs said in 2005, “is that we’re not very good going through orifices to get to the end users.” By <em>orifices</em>, he meant carriers like Verizon and AT&amp;T, which had final say over which phones could access their networks. “Carriers now have gained the upper hand in terms of the power of the relationship with the handset manufacturers,” he continued. “So the handset manufacturers are really getting these big thick books from the carriers telling them here’s what your phone’s going to be. We’re not good at that.”\\xa0</p></div>\\n<div><div><p>Jobs “wasn’t convinced that smartphones were going to be for anyone but the ‘pocket protector crowd.’”</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>Privately, Jobs had other reservations. One former Apple executive who had daily meetings with Jobs told me that the carrier issue wasn’t his biggest hang-up. He was concerned with a lack of focus in the company, and he “wasn’t convinced that smartphones were going to be for anyone but the ‘pocket protector crowd,’ as we used to call them.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Partnering with Motorola was an easy way to try to neutralize a threat to the iPod. Motorola would make the handset; Apple would do the iTunes software. “It was, How can we make it a very small experience, so they still had to buy an iPod? Give them a taste of iTunes and basically turn it into an iPod Shuffle so that they’ll want to upgrade to an iPod. That was the initial strategy,” Fadell says. “It was, ‘Let’s not cannibalize the iPod because it’s going so well.’ ”</p></div>\\n<div><p>As soon as the collaboration was made public, Apple’s voracious rumor mill started churning. With an iTunes phone on the horizon, blogs began feeding the anticipation for a transformative mobile device that had been growing for some time already.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Inside Apple, however, expectations for the Rokr could not have been lower. “We all knew how bad it was,” Fadell says. “They’re slow, they can’t get things to change, they’re going to limit the songs.” Fadell laughs aloud when discussing the Rokr today. “All of these things were coming together to make sure it was really a shitty experience.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>But there may have been another reason that Apple’s executives were tolerating the Rokr’s unfurling shittiness. “Steve was gathering information during those meetings” with Motorola and Cingular, Richard Williamson says. He was trying to figure out how he might pursue a deal that would let Apple retain control over the design of its phone. He considered having Apple buy its own bandwidth and become its own mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO. Apple approached Verizon, but the two companies were unable to ink a deal; telecoms still wanted too much control over how a handset was designed. An executive at Cingular, meanwhile, began to cobble together an alternative deal Jobs might actually embrace: <em>Give Cingular exclusivity, and we’ll give you complete freedom over the device</em>. </p></div>\\n<div><h2><strong>Fix What You Hate</strong></h2></div>\\n<div><p>From Steve Jobs to Jony Ive to Tony Fadell to Apple’s engineers, designers, and managers, there’s one part of the iPhone mythology that everyone tends to agree on: Before the iPhone, everyone at Apple thought cell phones “sucked.” They were “terrible.” Just “pieces of junk.” We’ve already seen how Jobs felt about phones that dropped calls.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“Apple is best when it’s fixing the things that people hate,” Greg Christie, who was head of Apple’s Human Interface Group at the time, tells me. Before the iPod, nobody could figure out how to use a digital music player; as Napster boomed, people took to carting around skip-happy portable CD players loaded with burned albums. And before the Apple II, computers were mostly considered too complex and unwieldy for the layperson.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“For at least a year before starting on what would become the iPhone project, even internally at Apple, we were grumbling about how all of these phones out there were all terrible,” says Nitin Ganatra, who managed Apple’s email team before working on the iPhone. It was water-cooler talk. But it reflected a growing sense inside the company that since Apple had successfully fixed — transformed, then dominated — one major product category, it could do the same with another.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“At the time,” Ganatra says, “it was like, ‘Oh my God, we need to go in and clean up this market too — why isn’t Apple making a phone?’ ”</p></div>\\n<div><h2>\\n<strong>Calling All Pods</strong>\\xa0</h2></div>\\n<div><p>Andy Grignon was restless. The versatile engineer had been at Apple for a few years, working in different departments on various projects. He’s a gleefully imposing figure— shaved-head bald, cheerful, and built like a friendly bear. He had a hand in everything from creating the software that powered the iPod to working on the software for a videoconferencing program and iChat. He’d become friends with rising star Tony Fadell when they’d built the iSight camera together.</p></div>\\n<div><p>After wrapping up another major project — writing the Mac feature Dashboard, which Grignon affectionately calls “his baby” (it’s the widget-filled screen with the calculator and the calendar and so on) — he was looking for something fresh to do. “Fadell reached out and said, ‘Do you want to come join iPod? We’ve got some really cool shit. I’ve got this other project I really want to do but we need some time before we can convince Steve to do it, and I think you’d be great for it.’”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Grignon is boisterous and hardworking. He’s also got a mouth like a Silicon Valley sailor. “So I left,” Grignon says, “to work on this mystery thing. So we just kind of spun our wheels on some wireless speakers and shit like that, but then the project started to materialize. Of course what Fadell was talking about was the phone.” Fadell knew Jobs was beginning to come around to the idea, and he wanted to be prepared. “We had this idea: Wouldn’t it be great to put WiFi in an iPod?” Grignon says. Throughout 2004, Fadell, Grignon, and the rest of the team worked on a number of early efforts to fuse iPod and internet communicator.</p></div>\\n<div><div><p>It was also the first time Steve Jobs had seen the internet running on an iPod. “And he was like, ‘This is bullshit.’”</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>“That was one of the very first prototypes I showed Steve. We gutted an iPod, we had hardware add in a WiFi part, so it was a big plastic piece of junk, and we modified the software.” There were click-wheel iPods that could clumsily surf the web as early as 2004. “You would click the wheel, you would scroll the web page, and if there was a link on the page, it would highlight it, and you could click on it and you could jump in,” Grignon says. “That was the very first time where we started experimenting with radios in the form factor.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>It was also the first time Steve Jobs had seen the internet running on an iPod. “And he was like, ‘This is bullshit.’ He called it right away… ‘I don’t want this. I know it works, I got it, great, thanks, but this is a shitty experience,’ ” Grignon says.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Meanwhile, Grignon says, “The exec team was trying to convince Steve that building a phone was a great idea for Apple. He didn’t really see the path to success.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>One of those trying to do the convincing was Mike Bell. A veteran of Apple, where he’d worked for fifteen years, and of Motorola’s wireless division, Bell was positive that computers, music players, and cell phones were heading toward an inevitable convergence point. For months, he lobbied Jobs to do a phone, as did Steve Sakoman, a vice president who had worked on the ill-fated Newton.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“We were spending all this time putting iPod features in Motorola phones,” Bell says. “That just seemed ass-backwards to me. If we just took the iPod user experience and some of the other stuff we were working on, we could own the market.” It was getting harder to argue with that logic. The latest batches of MP3 phones were looking increasingly like iPod competitors, and new alternatives for dealing with the carriers were emerging. Meanwhile, Bell had seen Jony Ive’s latest iPod designs.</p></div>\\n<div><p>On November 7, 2004, Bell sent Jobs a late-night email. “Steve, I know you don’t want to do a phone,” he wrote, “but here’s why we should do it: Jony Ive has some really cool designs for future iPods that no one has seen. We ought to take one of those, put some Apple software around it, and make a phone out if ourselves instead of putting our stuff on other people’s phones.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Jobs called him right away. They argued for hours, pushing back and forth. Bell detailed his convergence theory — no doubt mentioning the fact that the mobile phone market was exploding worldwide — and Jobs picked it apart. Finally, he relented.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“Okay, I think we should go do it,” he said.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“So Steve and I and Jony and Sakoman had lunch three or four days later and kicked off the iPhone project.”</p></div>\\n<div><h2><strong>Reviving the Apple Tablet</strong></h2></div>\\n<div><p>At 2 Infinite Loop, an older touchscreen-tablet research project was still chugging along. Bas Ording, Imran Chaudhri, and company were still exploring the contours of a basic touch-focused user interface.</p></div>\\n<div><p>One day, Bas Ording got a call from Steve. He said, “We’re gonna do a phone.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Years ago, a handful of input engineers and key designers had prototyped multitouch-focused interaction demos, followed by the Q79 tablet project — an experimental early stab at an iPad-like device. But a tangle of obstacles, not least of which was that it was too expensive, shut it down. (“You’ve got to give me something I can sell,” he told Imran.) But with a smaller screen and scaled-down system, Q79 might work as a phone.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“It’s gonna have a small screen, it’s gonna be just a touchscreen, there’s not gonna be any buttons, and everything has to work on that,” Jobs told Ording. He asked the UI wiz to make a demo of scrolling through a virtual address book with multitouch. “I was super-excited,” Ording says. “I thought, <em>Yeah, it seems kind of impossible, but it would be fun to just try it</em>.” He sat down, “moused off” a phone-size section of his Mac’s screen, and used it to model the iPhone surface. He and a scant few other designers had spent years experimenting with touch-based user interfaces — and those years in the touchscreen wilderness were paying off. </p></div>\\n<div><div><p>“When I saw the rubber band, inertial scrolling, and a few of the other things, I thought, ‘My God, we can build a phone out of this.’ ”</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>“We already had some other demos, a web page, for example — it was just a picture you could scroll with momentum,” Ording says. “That’s sort of how it started.” The famous effect where your screen bounces when you hit the top or bottom of a page was born because Ording couldn’t tell when he’d hit the top of a page. “I thought my program wasn’t running because I tried to scroll and nothing would happen,” he says, and then he’d realize he was scrolling in the wrong direction. “So that’s when I started to think, <em>How can I make it so you can see or feel that you’re at the end?</em> Right? Instead of feeling dead, like it’s not responding.”\\xa0</p></div>\\n<div><p>These small details, which we now take for granted, were the product of exhaustive tinkering, of proof-of-concept experimenting. Like inertial scrolling, the wonky-sounding but now-universal effect that makes scrolling down your contact list feel satisfyingly tactile; the names fly by in a burst after you swipe down, then slow to a tick-tock as if bound by real-world physics</p></div>\\n<div><p>“I had to try all kinds of things and figure out some math,” Ording says. “Not all of it was complicated, but you have to get to the right combinations, and that’s the tricky thing. ” Eventually, Ording got it to feel natural.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“He called me back a few weeks later, and he had inertial scrolling working,” Jobs said. “And when I saw the rubber band, inertial scrolling, and a few of the other things, I thought, ‘My God, we can build a phone out of this.’ ”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Scott Forstall walked into Greg Christie’s office near the end of 2004 and gave him the news too: Jobs wanted to do a phone. He’d been waiting about a decade to hear those words.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Christie is intense and brusque; his stocky build and sharp eyes feel loaded with kinetic energy. He joined Apple in the 1990s, when the company was in a downward spiral, just to work on the Newton— then one of the most promising mobile devices on the market. Then, he’d even tried to push Apple to do a Newton phone. “I’m sure I proposed it a dozen times,” Christie says. “The internet was popping too— this is going to be a big deal: mobile, internet, phone.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Now, his Human Interface team — his knobs-and-dials crew — was about to embark on its most radical challenge yet. Its members gathered on the second floor of 2 Infinite Loop, right above the old user-testing lab, and set to work expanding the features, functionality, and look of the old ENRI tablet project. The handful of designers and engineers set up shop in a drab office replete with stained carpet, old furniture, a leaky bathroom next door, and little on the walls but a whiteboard and, for some reason, a poster of a chicken.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Jobs liked the room because it was secure, windowless, tucked away from straying eyes. The CEO was already imbuing the nascent iPhone project with top-to-bottom secrecy. “You know, the cleaning crews weren’t allowed in here because there were these sliding whiteboards along the wall,” Christie says. The team would sketch ideas on them, and the good ones stayed put. “We wouldn’t erase them. They became part of the design conversation.”</p></div>\\n<div><div><p>Jobs liked the room because it was secure, windowless, tucked away from straying eyes</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>That conversation was about how to blend a touch-based UI with smartphone features.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Fortunately, they’d had a head start. There were the ENRI crew’s multitouch demos, of course. But Imran Chaudhri had also led the design for Dashboard, which was full of widgets — weather, stocks, calculator, notes, calendar — that would be ideal for the phone. “The early idea for the phone was all about having these widgets in your pocket,” Chaudhri says. So they ported them over.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The original design for many of those icons was actually created in a single night, back during the development of Dashboard. “It was one of those fucking crazy Steve deadlines,” Imran says, “where he wanted to see a demo of everything.” So he and Freddy Anzures, a recent hire to the HI team, spent a long night coming up with the rectilinear design concepts for the widgets — which would, years later, become the designs for the iPhone icons. “It’s funny, the look of smartphone icons for a decade to come was hashed out in a few hours.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>And they had to establish the fundamentals; for instance, What should it look like when you fire up your phone? A grid of apps seems like the obvious way to organize a smartphone’s functions today — now that it’s like water, as Chaudhri says — but it wasn’t a foregone conclusion. “We tried some other stuff,” Ording says. “Like, maybe it’s a list of icons with the names after them.” But what came to be called Springboard emerged early on as the standard. “They were little Chiclets, basically,” Ording says. “Now, that’s Imran too, that was a great idea, and it looked really nice.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Chaudhri had the Industrial Design team make a few wooden iPhone-like mock-ups so they could figure out the optimal size of the icons for a finger’s touch.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The multitouch demos were promising, and the style was coming together. But what the team lacked was cohesion — a united idea of what a touch-based phone would be.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“It was really just sketches,” Christie says. “Little fragments of ideas, like tapas. A little bit of this, a little of that. Could be part of Address Book, a slice of Safari.” Tapas wouldn’t sate Jobs, obviously; he wanted a full course. So he grew increasingly frustrated with the presentations.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“In January, in the New Year, he blows a gasket and tells us we’re not getting it,” Christie says. The fragments might have been impressive, but there was no narrative drawing the disparate parts together; it was a jumble of half-apps and ideas. There was no story.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“It was as if you delivered a story to your editor and it was a couple of sentences from the introductory paragraph, a few from the body, and then something from the middle of the conclusion — but not the concluding statement.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>It simply wasn’t enough. “Steve gave us an ultimatum,” Christie recalls. “He said, You have two weeks. It was February of 2005, and we kicked off this two-week death march.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>So Christie gathered the HI team to make the case that they should all march with him.</p></div>\\n<div><div><p>“It was February of 2005, and we kicked off this two-week death march.”</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>“Doing a phone is what I always wanted to do,” he said. “I think the rest of you want to do this also. But we’ve got two weeks for one last chance to do this. And I really want to do it.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>He wasn’t kidding. For a decade, Christie had believed mobile computing was destined to converge with cell phones. This was his opportunity not only to prove he was right, but to drive the spark.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The small team was on board: Bas, Imran, Christie, three other designers — Stephen LeMay, Marcel van Os, and Freddy Anzures — and a project manager, Patrick Coffman. They worked around the clock to tie those fragments into a full-fledged narrative.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“We basically went to the mattresses,” Christie says. Each designer was given a fragment to realize — an app to flesh out — and the team spent two sleepless weeks perfecting the shape and feel of an inchoate iPhone. And at the end of the death march, something resembling the one device emerged from the exhausted fog of the HI floor.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“I have no doubt that if I could resurrect that demo and show it to you now, you would have no problem recognizing it as an iPhone,” Christie says. There was a home button — still software-based at this point — scrolling, and the multitouch media manipulations.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“We showed Steve the outline of the whole story. Showed him the home screen, showed him how a call comes in, how to go to your Address Book, and ‘this is what Safari looks like,’ and it was a little click through. It wasn’t just some clever quotes, it told a story.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>And Steve Jobs did love a good story.</p></div>\\n<div><div><div><figcaption><em>Alternative iPhone prototype.</em></figcaption></div></div></div>\\n<div><p>“It was a smashing success,” Christie says. “He wanted to go through it a second time. Anyone who saw it thought it was great. It was great.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>It meant that the project was immediately deemed top secret. After the February demo, badge readers were installed on either end of the Human Interface group’s hallway, on the second floor of 2 Infinite Loop. “It was lockdown,” Christie says. “That’s what you say when there’s a prison riot, right? That was the phrase. Yeah, we’re on lockdown.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>It also meant they had a lot more work to do. If the touch interface research meetings were prologue, the tablet prototyping the beginning, then this was the second act of the iPhone, and there was much left to be written. But now that Jobs was invested in the narrative, he wanted to show it off, in high style, to the rest of the company. “We had this ‘big demo’ — that’s what we called it,” Ording says. Steve wanted to show the iPhone prototype at the Top 100 meeting inside Apple. “They have this meeting every once in a while with all the important people, saying what the direction of the company is,” Ording tells me. Jobs would invite the people he considered his top one hundred employees to a secret retreat, where they’d present and discuss upcoming products and strategies. For rising Applers, it was a make-or-break career opportunity. For Jobs, the presentations had to be as carefully calibrated as public-facing product launches.</p></div>\\n<div><div><p>“What are the apps we’re going to have? What should a calendar in your hand look like? Email?”</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>“From then until May, it was another brutal haul, to, well… \\xa0come up with connecting paragraphs,” Christie says. “Okay, what are the apps we’re going to have? What should a calendar in your hand look like? Email? Every step on this journey was just making it more and more concrete and more real. Playing songs out of your iTunes. Media playback. iPhone software started as a design project in my hallway with my team.” Christie hacked the latest model of the iPod so the designers could get a feel for what the applications might look like on a device. The demo began to take shape. “You could tap on the mail app and see how that kind of works, and the web browser,” Ording says. “It wasn’t fully working, but enough that you could get the idea.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Christie uses one word to describe how the team toiled around the clock, you might have noticed, above all others. It was “brutal, grueling work. I put people in hotel rooms because I didn’t want them driving home. People crashed at my house,” he says, but “it was exhilarating at the same time.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Steve Jobs had been blown away by the results. And soon, so was everyone else. The presentation at Top 100 was another smash success.</p></div>\\n<div><h2>\\n<strong>The Bod of an iPod</strong>\\xa0</h2></div>\\n<div><p>When Fadell heard that a phone project was taking shape, he grabbed his own skunkworks prototype design of the iPod phone before he headed into an executive meeting.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“There was a meeting where they were talking about the formation of the phone project on the team,” Grignon says. “Tony had [it] in his back pocket, a team already working on the hardware and the schematics, all the design for it. And once they got the approval for it from Steve, Tony was like, ‘Oh, hold on, as a matter of fact’— <em>whoochaa!</em> Like he whipped it out, ‘Here’s this prototype that we’ve been thinking about,’ and it was basically a fully baked design.” </p></div>\\n<div><p>On paper, the logic looks impeccable: The iPod was Apple’s most successful product, phones were going to eat the iPod’s lunch, so why not an iPod phone? “Take the best of the iPod and put a phone in it,” Fadell says. “So you could do mobile communications and have your music with you, and we didn’t lose all the brand awareness we’d built into the iPod, the half a billion dollars we were spending getting that known around the world.” It was that simple.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Remember that while it was becoming clear inside Apple that they were going to pursue a phone, it wasn’t clear at all what that phone should look or feel like. Or how it would work, on just about every level.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“Early 2005, around that time frame, Tony started saying there’s talk about them doing a phone,” says David Tupman, who was in charge of iPod hardware at the time. “And I said, ‘I really want to do a phone. I’d like to lead that.’ He said, ‘No.’ ” Tupman laughs. “ ‘You can’t do that.’ But they did a bunch of interviews, and I guess they couldn’t find anybody, so I was like, ‘Hello, I’m still here!’ Tony was like, ‘Okay, you’re it.’ ”</p></div>\\n<div><p>The iPod team wasn’t privy to what had been unfolding in the HI group.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“We were gonna build what everyone thought we should build at the time: Let’s bolt a phone onto an iPod,” says Andy Grignon. And that’s exactly what they started to do.</p></div>\\n<div><h2><strong>What’s It Going to Be?</strong></h2></div>\\n<div><p>Richard Williamson found himself in Steve Jobs’s office. He’d gone in to discuss precisely the kind of thing that nobody wanted to discuss with Steve Jobs — leaving Apple.</p></div>\\n<div><p>For years, he had been in charge of the team that developed the framework that powered Safari, called WebKit. Here’s a fun fact about WebKit: Unlike most products developed and deployed by Apple, it’s open-source. Here’s another: Until 2013, Google’s own Chrome browser was powered by WebKit too. It’s big-deal software, in other words. And Williamson was, as <em>Forbes</em> put it, “what’s commonly referred to as a ‘@#$ rock star’ in Silicon Valley.” But he was getting burned out on upgrading the same platform. </p></div>\\n<div><p>“We had gone through three or four versions of WebKit, and I was thinking of moving to Google,” he says. “That’s when Steve invited me.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>And Steve wasn’t happy.</p></div>\\n<div><p>When you think “successful computer engineer,” the stock photo that springs to mind is pretty much what Williamson looks like — bespectacled, unrepentantly geekish, brainy, wearing a button-down shirt. We met for an interview at a Palo Alto sushi joint that eschewed waiters in favor of automated service via table-mounted iPads. Seemed fitting.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Williamson is soft-spoken, with a light British accent. He seems affable but shy — there’s a slightly anxious undercurrent to his speech — and unmistakably sharp. He’s apt to rattle off ideas pulled from a deep knowledge of code, industry acumen, and the philosophy of technology, sometimes in the same breath.</p></div>\\n<div><div><div><figcaption><em>Alternative iPhone prototype.</em></figcaption></div></div></div>\\n<div><p>In the mid-‘80s, a friend convinced Williamson to start a company writing software for the Commodore Amiga, an early PC. “We wrote a program called Marauder, which was a program to make archival backups of copy-protected disks.” He laughs. “That’s kind of the diplomatic way of describing the program.” Basically, they created a tool that allowed users to pirate software. “So we had a little bit of a recurring revenue stream,” he says slyly.</p></div>\\n<div><p>In 1985, Steve Jobs’s post-Apple company, NeXT, was still a small operation, and hungry for good engineers. There, Williamson met with two NeXT officers and one Steve Jobs. He showed them the work that he’d done on the Amiga, and they hired him on the spot. The young programmer would go on to spend the next quarter of a century in Jobs’s— and the NeXT team’s— orbit, working on the software that would become integral to the iPhone.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“Don’t leave,” Jobs said, according to Williamson. “We’ve got a new project I think you might be interested in.”</p></div>\\n<div><div><p>“Don’t leave,” Jobs said, according to Williamson. “We’ve got a new project I think you might be interested in.”</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>So Williamson asked to see it. “At this point, there was nobody on the project from a software perspective, it was all just kind of an idea in Steve’s mind.” It didn’t seem like a convincing reason for Williamson to pass up an enticing new offer. “Google was interested in giving me some very interesting work too, so it was a very pivotal moment,” he says.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“So I said, ‘Well, the screen isn’t there, the display tech is kind of not really there.’ But Steve convinced me it was. That the path would be there.” Williamson pauses for a second. “It’s all true about Steve,” Williamson says with a quick smile. “I was with him since NeXT, and I’ve fallen under his glare many times.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>What would it be, then? Of course, Williamson would stay. “So I became an advocate at that point of building a device to browse the web.”</p></div>\\n<div><h2>\\n<strong>Which Phone</strong> </h2></div>\\n<div><p>“Steve wanted to do a phone, and he wanted to do it as fast as he could,” Williamson says. But which phone?</p></div>\\n<div><p>There were two options: (a) take the beloved, widely recognizable iPod and hack it to double as a phone (that was the easier path technologically, and Jobs wasn’t envisioning the iPhone as a mobile computing device but as a souped-up phone), or (b) transmogrify a Mac into a tiny touch-tablet that made calls (which was an exciting idea but frayed with futuristic abstraction).</p></div>\\n<div><p>“After the big demo,” Ording says, “the engineers started to look into, What would it take to actually make this real? On the hardware side but also the software side,” Ording says. To say the engineers who first examined it were skeptical about its near-term viability would be an understatement. “They went, ‘Oh my God, this is— we don’t know, this is going to be a lot of work. We don’t even know how much work.’ ”</p></div>\\n<div><p>There was so much that needed to be done to translate the multitouch Mac mass into a product, and one with so many new, unproven technologies, that it was difficult even to put forward a roadmap, to conceive of all of its pieces coming together.</p></div>\\n<div><h2>\\n<strong>For Those About to Rokr</strong>\\xa0</h2></div>\\n<div><p>Development had continued on the Rokr throughout 2005. “We all thought the Rokr was a joke,” Williamson says. The famously hands-on CEO didn’t see the finished Rokr until early September 2005, right before he was supposed to announce it to the world. And he was aghast. “He was like, ‘What else can we do, how can we fix it?’ He knew it was subpar but he didn’t know how bad it was going to be. When it finally got there, he didn’t even want to show it onstage because he was so embarrassed by it,” Fadell says.</p></div>\\n<div><p>During the demonstration, Jobs held the phone like an unwashed sock. At one point the Rokr failed to switch from making calls to playing music, leaving him visibly agitated. So, at about the same moment that Jobs was announcing “the world’s first mobile phone with iTunes” to the media, he was resolving to make it obsolete. He helped by lavishing praise on the new iPod Nano, clearly elevating it as the star of the show and reportedly leaving Motorola execs fuming.</p></div>\\n<div><div><p>Rokr’s sheer shittiness took Jobs by surprise</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>“When he got offstage he was just like, ‘Ugh,’ really upset,” Fadell says. The Rokr was such a disaster that it landed on the cover of <em>Wired</em> with the headline “You Call This the Phone of the Future?” and it was soon being returned at a rate six times higher than the industry average. Its sheer shittiness took Jobs by surprise — and his anger helped motivate him to squeeze the trigger harder on an Apple-built phone. “It wasn’t when it failed. It was right after it launched,” Fadell says. “This is not gonna fly. I’m sick and tired of dealing with bozo handset guys,” Jobs told Fadell after the demo. </p></div>\\n<div><p>“That was the ultimate thing,” Fadell says. “It was, ‘Fuck this, we’re going to make our own phone.’ ”</p></div>\\n<div><p>“Steve called a big meeting in the boardroom,” Ording says. “Everyone was there, Phil Schiller and Jony Ive and whoever.” He said, “Listen. We’re going to change plans… \\xa0We’re going to do this iPod-based thing, make that into a phone because that’s a much more doable project. More predictable.” That was Fadell’s project. The touchscreen effort wasn’t abandoned, but while the engineers worked on whipping it into shape, Jobs directed Ording, Chaudhri, and members of the UI team to design an interface for an iPod phone, a way to dial numbers, select contacts, and browse the web using that device’s tried-and-true click wheel.</p></div>\\n<div><p>There were now two competing projects vying to become the iPhone — a “bake-off,” as some engineers put it. The two phone projects were split into tracks, code-named P1 and P2, respectively. Both were top secret. P1 was the iPod phone. P2 was the still-experimental hybrid of multitouch technology and Mac software.</p></div>\\n<div><p>If there’s a ground zero for the political strife that would later come to engulf the project, it’s likely here, in the decision to split the two teams — Fadell’s iPod division, which was still charged with updating that product line in addition to prototyping the iPod phone, and Scott Forstall’s Mac OS software vets — and drive them to compete. (The Human Interface designers, meanwhile, worked on both P1 and P2.)</p></div>\\n<div><p>Eventually, the executives overseeing the most important elements of the iPhone — software, hardware, and industrial design — would barely be able to tolerate sitting in the same room together. One would quit, others would be fired, and one would emerge solidly — and perhaps solely — as the new face of Apple’s genius in the post-Jobs era. Meanwhile, the designers, engineers, and coders would work tirelessly, below the political fray, to turn the Ps into working devices in any way possible.</p></div>\\n<div><h2><strong>The Purple People Leader</strong></h2></div>\\n<div><p>Every top secret project worth its salt in intrigue has a code name. The iPhone’s was Purple.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“One of the buildings we have up in Cupertino, we locked it down,” said Scott Forstall, who had managed Mac OS X software and who would come to run the entire iPhone software program. “We started with one floor”— where Greg Christie’s Human Interface team worked — “We locked the entire floor down. We put doors with badge readers, there were cameras, I think, to get to some of our labs, you had to badge in four times to get there.” He called it the Purple Dorm because, “much like a dorm, people were there all the time.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>They “put up a sign that said ‘Fight Club’ because the first rule of Fight Club in the movie is that you don’t talk about Fight Club, and the first rule about the Purple Project is you do not talk about that outside of those doors,” Forstall said.</p></div>\\n<div><div><p>Every top secret project worth its salt in intrigue has a code name. The iPhone’s was Purple.</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>Why Purple? Few seem to recall. One theory is it was named after a purple aardvark toy that Scott Herz — one of the first engineers to come to work on the iPhone — had as a mascot for Radar, the system that Apple engineers used to keep track of software bugs and glitches throughout the company. “All the bugs are tracked inside of Radar at Apple, and a lot of people have access to Radar,” says Richard Williamson. “So if you’re a curious engineer, you can go spelunking around the bug-tracking system and find out what people are working on. And if you’re working on a secret project, you have to think about how to cover your tracks there.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Scott Forstall, born in 1969, had been downloading Apple into his brain his entire life. By junior high, his precocious math and science skills landed him in an advanced-placement course with access to an Apple IIe computer. He learned to code, and to code well. Forstall didn’t fit the classic computer-geek mold, though. He was a debate team champ and a performer in high-school musicals; he played the lead in <em>Sweeney Todd</em>, that hammy demon barber. Forstall graduated from Stanford in 1992 with a master’s in computer science and landed a job at NeXT. </p></div>\\n<div><div><div><figcaption><em>Alternative iPhone prototype.</em></figcaption></div></div></div>\\n<div><p>After releasing an overpriced computer aimed at the higher education market, NeXT flailed as a hardware company, but it survived by licensing its powerful NeXTSTEP operating system. In 1996, Apple bought NeXT and brought Jobs back into the fold, and the decision was made to use NeXTSTEP to overhaul the Mac’s aging operating system. It became the foundation on which Macs— and iPhones— still run today. At Jobs-led Apple, Forstall rose through the ranks. He mimicked his idol’s management style and distinctive taste. <em>BusinessWeek</em> called him “the Sorcerer’s Apprentice.” </p></div>\\n<div><p>One of his former colleagues praised him as a smart, savvy leader but said he went overboard on the Jobs-worship: “He was generally great, but sometimes it was like, just be yourself.” Forstall emerged as the leader of the effort to adapt Mac software to a touchscreen phone. Though some found his ego and naked ambition distasteful — he was “very much in need of adulation,” according to one peer, and called “a starfucker” by another — few dispute the caliber of his intellect and work ethic. “I don’t know what other people have said about Scott,” Henri Lamiraux says, “but he was a pleasure to work with.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Forstall led many of the top engineers he’d worked with since his NeXT days — Henri Lamiraux and Richard Williamson among them — into the P2 project. Williamson jokingly called the crew “the NeXT mafia.” True to the name, they would at times behave in a manner befitting a close-knit, secretive (and highly efficient) organization.</p></div>\\n<div><h2><strong>P1 Thing After Another</strong></h2></div>\\n<div><p>Tony Fadell was Forstall’s chief competition.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“From a politics perspective, Tony wanted to own the entire experience,” Grignon says. “The software, the hardware… once people started to see the importance of this project to Apple, everyone wanted to get their fingers in it. And that’s when the epic fight between Fadell and Forstall began.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Having worked with Forstall on Dashboard, Grignon was in a unique position to interface with both groups. “From our perspective, Forstall and his crew, we always viewed them as the underdogs. Like they were trying to wedge their way in,” Grignon says. “We had complete confidence that our stack was going to happen because this is Tony’s project, and Tony’s responsible for millions upon millions of iPod sales.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>So, the pod team worked to produce a new pod-phone cut from the mold of Apple’s ubiquitous music player. Their idea was to produce an iPod that would have two distinct modes: the music player and a phone. “We prototyped a new way,” Grignon says of the early device. “It was this interesting material… \\xa0it still had this touch sensitive click wheel, right, and the Play/Pause/Next/Previous buttons in blue backlighting. And when you put it into phone mode through the UI, all that light kind of faded out and faded back in as orange. Like, zero to nine in the click wheel in an old rotary phone, you know, ABCDEGF around the edges.” When the device was in musicplaying mode, blue backlighting would show iPod controls around the touch wheel. The screen would still be filled with iPod-style text and lists, and if you toggled it to phone mode, it’d glow orange and display numbers like the dial of a rotary phone.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“We put a radio inside, effectively an iPod Mini with a speaker and headphones, still using the touch-wheel interface,” Tupman says.</p></div>\\n<div><div><div><figcaption><em>From an Apple patent application filed in 2006 for a rotary phone-style dial within an iPod.</em></figcaption></div></div></div>\\n<div><p>“And when you texted, it dialed — and it worked!” Grignon says. “So we built a couple hundred of them.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>The problem was that they were difficult to use as phones. “After we made the first iteration of the software, it was clear that this was going nowhere,” Fadell says. “Because of the wheel interface. It was never gonna work because you don’t want a rotary dial on the phone.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>The design team tried mightily to hack together a solution.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“I came up with some ideas for the predictive typing,” Bas Ording says. There would be an alphabet laid out at the bottom of the screen, and users would use the wheel to select letters. “And then you can just, like, <em>click-click-click-click</em> — ‘Hello, how are you.’ So I just built an actual thing that can learn as you type — it would build up a database of words that follow each other.” But the process was still too tedious. </p></div>\\n<div><p>“It was just obvious that we were overloading the click wheel with too much,” Grignon says. “And texting and phone numbers — it was a fucking mess.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>“We tried everything,” Fadell says. “And nothing came out to make it work. Steve kept pushing and pushing, and we were like, ‘Steve.’ He’s pushing the rock up a hill. Let’s put it this way: I think he knew, I could tell in his eyes that he knew; he just wanted it to work,” he says. “He just kept beating this dead horse.”</p></div>\\n<div><div><p>“I guess Steve must have woken up one day like, ‘This is not as exciting as the touch stuff.’ ”</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>“C’mon, there’s gotta be a way,” Jobs would tell Fadell. “He didn’t just want to give up. So he pushed until there was nothing there,” Fadell says.</p></div>\\n<div><p>They even filed for a patent for the ill-fated device, and in the bowels of Cupertino, there were offices and labs littered with dozens of working iPod phones. “We actually made phone calls,” Grignon says.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The first calls from an Apple phone were not, it turns out, made on the sleek touchscreen interface of the future but on a steampunk rotary dial. “We came very close,” Ording says. “It was, like, we could have finished it and made a product out of it… But then I guess Steve must have woken up one day like, ‘This is not as exciting as the touch stuff.’ ”</p></div>\\n<div><p>“For us on the hardware team, it was great experience,” David Tupman says. “We got to build RF radio boards, it forced us to select suppliers, it pushed us to get everything in place.” In fact, elements of the iPod phone wound up migrating into the final iPhone; it was like a version 0.1, Tupman says. For instance: “The radio system that was in that iPod phone was the one that shipped in the actual iPhone.”</p></div>\\n<div><h2><strong>Hands Off</strong></h2></div>\\n<div><p>The first time Fadell saw P2’s touch-tablet rig in action, he was impressed — and perplexed. “Steve pulled me in a room when everything was failing on the iPod phone and said, ‘Come and look at this.’ ” Jobs showed him the ENRI team’s multitouch prototype. “They had been getting, in the background, the touch Mac going. But it wasn’t a touch Mac; literally, it was a room with a PingPong table, a projector, and this thing that was a big touchscreen,” Fadell says.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“This is what I want to put on the phone,” Jobs said.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“Steve, sure,” Fadell replied. “It’s not even close to production. It’s a prototype, and it’s not a prototype at scale — it’s a prototype table. It’s a research project. It was like eight percent there,” Fadell says.</p></div>\\n<div><p>David Tupman was more optimistic. “I was like, ‘Oh, wow, yeah, we <em>have</em> to find out a way to make this work.’ ” He was convinced the engineering challenges could be solved. “I said, ‘Let’s just sit down and go through the numbers and let’s work it out.’ ” </p></div>\\n<div><div><div><figcaption><em>Alternative iPhone prototype.</em></figcaption></div></div></div>\\n<div><p>The iPod phone was losing support. The executives debated which project to pursue, but Phil Schiller, Apple’s head of marketing, had an answer: Neither. He wanted a keyboard with hard buttons. The BlackBerry was arguably the first hit smartphone. It had an email client and a tiny hard keyboard. After everyone else, including Fadell, started to agree that multitouch was the way forward, Schiller became the lone holdout.</p></div>\\n<div><p>He “just sat there with his sword out every time, going, ‘No, we’ve got to have a hard keyboard. No. Hard keyboard.’ And he wouldn’t listen to reason as all of us were like, ‘No, this works now, Phil.’ And he’d say, ‘You gotta have a hard keyboard!’ ” Fadell says.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Schiller didn’t have the same technological acumen as many of the other execs. “Phil is not a technology guy,” Brett Bilbrey, the former head of Apple’s Advanced Technology Group, says. “There were days when you had to explain things to him like a grade-school kid.” Jobs liked him, Bilbrey thinks, because he “looked at technology like middle America does, like Grandma and Grandpa did.”</p></div>\\n<div><div><p>“[Schiller] was told, like, Get on the program or get the fuck out. And he ultimately caved.”</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>When the rest of the team had decided to move on multitouch and a virtual keyboard, Schiller put his foot down. “There was this one spectacular meeting where we were finally going in a direction,” Fadell says, “and he erupted.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>“We’re making the wrong decision!” Schiller shouted.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“Steve looked at him and goes, ‘I’m sick and tired of this stuff. Can we get off of this?’ And he threw him out of the meeting,” Fadell recalls. Later, he says, “Steve and he had it out in the hallway. He was told, like, Get on the program or get the fuck out. And he ultimately caved.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>That cleared it up: the phone would be based on a touchscreen. “We all know this is the one we want to do,” Jobs said in a meeting, pointing to the touchscreen. “So let’s make it work.”</p></div>\\n<div><h2><strong>Round Two</strong></h2></div>\\n<div><p>“There was a whole religious war over the phone” between the iPod team and the Mac OS crew, one former Apple executive told me. When the iPod wheel was ruled out and the touch ruled in, the new question was how to build the phone’s operating system. This was a critical juncture — it would determine whether the iPhone would be positioned as an accessory or as a mobile computer.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“Tony and his team were arguing we should evolve the operating system and take it in the direction of the iPod, which was very rudimentary,” Richard Williamson says. “And myself and Henri and Scott Forstall, we were all arguing we should take OS X” — Apple’s main operating system, which ran on its desktops and laptops — “and shrink it down.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>“There were some epic battles, philosophical battles about trying to decide what to do,” Williamson says.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The NeXT mafia saw an opportunity to create a true mobile computing device and wanted to squeeze the Mac’s operating system onto the phone, complete with versions of Mac apps. They knew the operating system inside and out — it was based on code they’d worked with for over a decade. “We knew for sure that there was enough horsepower to run a modern operating system,” Williamson says, and they believed they could use a compact ARM processor — Sophie Wilson’s low-power chip architecture — to create a stripped-down computer on a phone.</p></div>\\n<div><div><p>“There were some epic battles, philosophical battles about trying to decide what to do.”</p></div></div>\\n<div><p>The iPod team thought that was too ambitious and that the phone should run a version of Linux, the open-source system popular with developers and open-source advocates, which already ran on low-power ARM chips. “Now we’ve built this phone,” says Andy Grignon, “but we have this big argument about what was the operating system it should be built on. ’Cause we were initially making it iPod-based, right? And nobody cares what the operating system in an iPod is. It’s an appliance, an accessory. We were viewing the phone in that same camp.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>Remember, even after the iPhone’s launch, Steve Jobs would describe it as “more like an iPod” than a computer. But those who’d been in the trenches experimenting with the touch interface were excited about the possibilities it presented for personal computing and for evolving the human-machine interface. “There was definitely discussion: This is just an iPod with a phone. And we said, no, it’s OS X with a phone,” Henri Lamiraux says. “That’s what created a lot of conflict with the iPod team, because they thought they were the team that knew about all the software on small devices. And we were like, no, okay, it’s just a computer.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>“At this point we didn’t care about the phone at all,” Williamson says. “The phone’s largely irrelevant. It’s basically a modem. But it was ‘What is the operating system going to be like, what is the interaction paradigm going to be like?’ ” In that comment, you can read the roots of the philosophical clash: The software engineers saw P2 not as a chance to build a phone, but as an opportunity to use a phone-shaped device as a Trojan horse for a much more complex kind of mobile computer.</p></div>\\n<div><h2>\\n<strong>The Incredible Shrinking Operating System</strong> </h2></div>\\n<div><p>When the two systems squared off early on, the mobile-computing approach didn’t fare so well.</p></div>\\n<div><p>“Uh, just the load time was laughable,” Andy Grignon says. Grignon’s Linux option was fast and simple. “It’s just kind of <em>prrrrrt</em> and it’s up.” When the Mac team first got their system compiling, “it was like six rows of hashtags, <em>dink-dink-dink-dink-dink</em>, and then it just sat there and it would shit the bed for a little bit, and then it would finally come back up and you’d be like, Are you even kidding me? And this is supposed to be for a device that just turns on? Like, for real?” </p></div>\\n<div><p>“At that point it was up to us to prove” that a variant of OS X could work on the device, Williamson says. The mafia got to work, and the competition heightened. “We wanted our vision for this phone that Apple was going to release to become a reality,” Nitin Ganatra says. “We didn’t want to let the iPod team have an iPod-ish version of the phone come out before.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>One of the first orders of business was to demonstrate that the scrolling that had wowed Jobs would work with the stripped-down operating system. Williamson linked up with Ording and hashed it out. “It worked and looked amazingly real. When you touched the screen, it would track your finger perfectly, you would pull down, it would pull down.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>That, Williamson says, put the nail in the Linux pod’s coffin. “Once we had OS X ported and these basic scrolling interactions nailed, the decision was made: We’re not going to go with the iPod stack, we’re going to go with OS X.”</p></div>\\n<div><p>The software for the iPhone would be built by Scott Forstall’s NeXT mafia; the hardware would go to Fadell’s group. The iPhone would boast a touchscreen and pack the power of a mobile computer. That is, if they could get the thing to work.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Brian Merchant is the author of <em>The One Device: the Secret History of the iPhone</em>.

After more than two years of development, the device was first released in the <a>United States</a> in 2007. The iPhone was subsequently released in <a>Europe</a> in 2007 and <a>Asia</a> in 2008.</p>\\n<p>Apple designed its first mobile <a>smartphone</a> to run the <a>Mac OS X</a> <a>operating system</a>, made popular on the company’s <a>personal computers</a>. The device’s most revolutionary element was its touch-sensitive multisensor interface. The touchscreen allowed users to manipulate all programs and <a>telephone</a> functions with their fingertips rather than a stylus or physical keys. This interface—perfected, if not invented, by Apple—recreated a <a>tactile</a> physical experience; for example, the user could shrink photos with a pinching motion or flip through music albums using a flicking motion. The iPhone also featured <a>Internet</a> browsing, music and video playback, a digital camera, visual voicemail, and a tabbed contact list.</p>\\n<a><div>\\n<div>Britannica Quiz</div>\\n<div>The Dating Game: Which Came First?</div>\\n</div></a><p>The iPhone joined several competing products in the smartphone market, and critics and fans alike noted that it offered few truly original features. The main appeal of the iPhone was its incorporation of intuitive software and a simplified appealing interface, as well as the capacity to accommodate new user-selected software. More than 100 million applications (or “<a>apps</a>”) were downloaded in the first 60 days after Apple opened its online iPhone App Store in 2008, and by January 2010 more than three billion apps had been downloaded from the store.</p>\\n<p>In 2008, only a year after its <a>debut</a>, Apple released a second version of the iPhone that was updated to use third-generation (3G) wireless <a>technology</a>. As with the original iPhone, demand was high, and the new iPhone 3G sold one million units in the first three days after its introduction. In addition to hardware changes such as a 3-megapixel digital camera that could also record digital videos and an internal digital <a>compass</a> (capable of working with various mapping software), the <a>iPhone 3GS</a> included a new operating system, the iPhone OS 3.0. The new system included support for voice-activated controls and peer-to-peer (<a>P2P</a>) play of <a>electronic games</a> with other iPhone users over <a>Wi-Fi</a> Internet connections. The latter feature was part of Apple’s strategy to compete in the portable gaming market with the Nintendo Company’s DS and the <a>Sony Corporation</a>’s PSP.</p>\\n<div><div><figure><figcaption><a>iPhone 4</a><div>\\n<span>The Apple iPhone 4, released in 2010, was the first iPhone to feature a front-facing camera. It was the first iPhone to support FaceTime calls.</span><button><span>(more)</span></button>\\n</div></figcaption></figure></div></div>\\n<p>Officially unveiled in June 2010, the <a>iPhone 4</a> was thinner than its <a>predecessor</a> and offered improved battery life as well as a 5-megapixel camera. It featured a front-facing camera for video chat and selfies. The iPhone 4 ran on <a>iOS</a> 4, a multiplatform operating system that allowed users to run multiple apps simultaneously. In October 2011 Apple released the iPhone 4S. Among the improvements were an 8-megapixel camera and Siri, a personal assistant program that responded to spoken commands and questions. The new version of the operating system, iOS 5, contained iMessage, a messaging system that allowed conversations between any devices running iOS 5, and allowed users to store information on Apple’s new cloud-computing service, iCloud.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 5, introduced in September 2012, had a taller screen. Improved versions, the 5C and the more expensive 5S, were released in September 2013. The 5S had a <a>fingerprint</a> lock system called Touch <a>ID</a> and a motion coprocessor, which was solely devoted to processing information from the phone’s motion sensors, thus freeing up resources on the main processor.</p>\\n<div><div>Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.<a>Subscribe Now</a>\\n</div></div>\\n<div><div><figure><figcaption><a>iPhone 6</a><div>\\n<span>The iPhone 6, released in 2014.</span><button><span>(more)</span></button>\\n</div></figcaption></figure></div></div>\\n<p>In September 2014 the <a>iPhone 6</a> and the larger 6 Plus were unveiled. The 6 Plus was significantly thinner than previous versions (which actually made it susceptible to unintentional bending if left in a user’s pocket too long). The new operating system version, iOS 8, had such features as the ability to suggest words or phrases a user might type next, based on the recipient of the message, and the ability to identify which applications were an excessive drain on <a>battery</a> life.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were released in September 2016. The 7 Plus had a camera with a “portrait mode,” in which a foreground subject was in focus against a blurred background, and a second telephoto camera on the back. In both phones Apple eliminated the <a>headphone</a> jack. Headphones could be connected to the Lightning port on the bottom of the phone. Apple introduced wireless headphones called AirPods that could connect to the iPhone through <a>Bluetooth</a>.</p>\\n<p>In September 2017 Apple released the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. The only distinctive feature was the addition of inductive charging, in which the phone could charge wirelessly. Two months later Apple introduced the iPhone X, in which the screen covered the whole front surface of the device. The home button at the bottom of the iPhone was removed, and users no longer used their fingerprint but instead used facial recognition to unlock their phones.</p>\\n<p>In the late 2010s and early 2020s, new iPhone models concentrated on <a>incremental</a> improvements to the cameras, screen resolution, and processing power. The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max (introduced in September 2019) were the first models to have three cameras on the back, the third camera being able to take ultrawide-angle pictures. In 2020 the iPhone 12 Pro was released, followed by the iPhone 13 Pro in 2021.</p>\\n<p>In a milestone moment in 2023, Apple announced that the newest model, the iPhone 15, would begin using USB-C chargers and charging ports. The announcement came in the wake of increased pressure from European regulators to standardize phone chargers, <a>citing</a> that the switch would lead to reduced digital waste. The iPhone 15 would also feature higher-quality cameras and smaller screen borders.</p></section> <span><a>The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica</a></span><span>This article was most recently revised and updated by <a>Tara Ramanathan</a>.</span>\\n</div></div>\\n</div></div>\\n</div></div></div></div></div>\\n</div></article></div></div></div></div></main>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n\",\n",

Jobs recruited a group of Apple engineers to investigate the idea as a side project.<sup><a>[3]</a></sup> When Jobs reviewed the prototype and its user interface, he conceived a second idea of implementing the technology onto a mobile phone.<sup><a>[4]</a></sup>The whole effort was called the Project Purple 2 and began in 2005.<sup><a>[5]</a></sup></p>\\n<p>Apple created the device during a secretive and unprecedented collaboration with AT&amp;T, formerly Cingular Wireless. The development cost of the collaboration was estimated to have been $150 million<sup><a>[6]</a></sup> over a thirty-month period. Apple rejected the \"design by committee\" approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1, a largely unsuccessful collaboration with Motorola. Instead, Cingular Wireless gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone\\'s hardware and software in-house.<sup><a>[7]</a></sup><sup><a>[8]</a></sup></p>\\n<figure> <figcaption> <p>Steve Jobs iPhone 2007 Presentation (HD)</p> </figcaption> </figure><p>The original iPhone was introduced by Steve Jobs on <a>January 9</a>, <a>2007</a> in a keynote address at the <a>Macworld Conference &amp; Expo</a> held in Moscone West in <a>San Francisco</a>, <a>California</a>.<sup><a>[3]</a></sup> In his address, Jobs said, \"I have been looking forward to this for two and a half years\", and that \"today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.\"<sup><a>[9]</a></sup> Jobs introduced the iPhone as a combination of three devices: a \"widescreen iPod with touch controls\"; a \"revolutionary mobile phone\"; and a \"breakthrough Internet communicator\".<sup><a>[10]</a></sup></p>\\n<h3><span>Release</span></h3>\\n<p>The iPhone was released on <a>June 29</a>, <a>2007</a> in the United States where thousands of people were reported to have waited outside <a>Apple</a> and <a>AT&amp;T</a> retail stores days before the device\\'s launch;<sup><a>[11]</a></sup> with many stores reporting stock shortages within an hour. To avoid repeating the problems of the PlayStation 3 launch, which caused burglaries and even a shooting, off-duty police officers were hired to guard stores overnight.<sup><a>[12]</a></sup></p>\\n<p>It was later made available in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany in November 2007, and the Republic of Ireland and Austria in the spring of 2008.</p>\\n<p>Six out of ten Americans surveyed said they knew the iPhone was coming before its release.<sup><a>[13]</a></sup></p>\\n<figure> <figcaption> <p>IPhone (1st generation) - Original Guided Tour 2007</p> </figcaption> </figure><h3><span>Post-release</span></h3>\\n<p>The <a>iPod touch</a>, a touchscreen device with the media and internet abilities and interface of the iPhone, but without the ability to connect to a cellular network for phone functions or internet access, was released on <a>September 5</a>, 2007. At the same time, Apple significantly dropped the price of the 8 GB model while discontinuing the 4 GB model.<sup><a>[14]</a></sup> Apple sold the one millionth iPhone five days later, or 74 days after the release.<sup><a>[15]</a></sup> After receiving \"hundreds of emails...upset\" about the price drop, Apple gave store credit to early adopters.<sup><a>[16]</a></sup></p>\\n<p>A 16 GB model was released on <a>February 5</a>, <a>2008</a>.<sup><a>[17]</a></sup> Apple released an SDK on <a>March 6</a>, 2008, allowing developers to create the apps that would be available starting in iPhone OS version 2.0, a free upgrade for iPhone users. On <a>June 9</a>, Apple announced the <a>iPhone 3G</a>, which began shipping <a>July 11</a> with support for <a>3G</a> networks.<sup><a>[18]</a></sup> The original iPhone was discontinued at that time; total sales volume came to 6,124,000 units.<sup><a>[19]</a></sup></p>\\n<figure> <figcaption> <p>iPhone 2G running iPhone OS 1.0.</p> </figcaption> </figure><p>While most Apple literature simply called the device \"iPhone,\" and users call the iPhone \"iPhone 2G\" or \"iPhone 1\", the term \"original iPhone\" appears in a press release from July <a>2010</a>, and most recently an Apple support document last updated in March <a>2022</a><sup><a>[20]</a></sup><sup><a>[21]</a></sup></p>\\n<h2><span>Design</span></h2>\\n<p>The original iPhone\\'s design was centered on a glass multi-touch touchscreen display. The original iPhone introduced five <a>physical buttons</a> that have remained consistent over newer generations of iPhone. The device featured a chrome plated metal frame. The back of which was made of aluminum with a black plastic base, required because metal blocks cellular and Wi-Fi signals.<sup><a>[22]</a></sup></p>\\n<p>The 2MP camera was located in the upper-left corner of the iPhone\\'s rear. The headphone socket was recessed into the casing making it incompatible with most headsets without the use of an adapter. Other models do not have this issue.<sup><a>[22]</a></sup></p>\\n<h2><span>Software</span></h2>\\n<p>During release, the iPhone was marketed as running \"OS X\". The name of the operating system was revealed as iPhone OS in the iPhone 2.0 SDK.Apple has released 13 major software versions for the iPhone, including the one bundled with original iPhone units, but software updates for the original up to the <a>iPhone 6</a> have been discontinued.</p>\\n<h3><span>Software history</span></h3>\\n<p>The original release of the operating system included Visual Voicemail, multi-touch gestures, HTML email, Safari web browser, threaded text messaging, and YouTube.However, many features like MMS, apps, and copy and paste were not supported at release. These missing features led to hackers \"jailbreaking\" their phones and getting paid to jailbreak others which added these missing features. Official software updates slowly added these features.</p>\\n<p><b><a>iPhone OS 2</a></b>, released <a>July 11</a>, <a>2008</a>, introduced applications, exchange support, push e-mail, and other enhancements.</p>\\n<p><b><a>iPhone OS 3</a></b>, released <a>June 17</a>, <a>2009</a>, introduced copy and paste, and new YouTube features. Some features were designed for newer iPhone models and were not supported on the original iPhone.</p>\\n<p>Unlike the <a>iPhone 3G</a>, the original iPhone did not receive the <a>iOS 4</a> update.</p>\\n<h2><span>Hardware</span></h2>\\n<p>Apart from the unknown-purpose Apple 338S0297 in the original iPhone, Apple originally did not actually manufacture the iPhone to any extent, they only wrote the firmware for the hardware they planned to have used in the iPhone, wrote the software, and planned the design. The final hardware that Foxconn manufactured the iPhone with based on Apple\\'s design is as follows:<sup><a>[23]</a></sup></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<a>Samsung</a> S5L8900 Application Processor<sup><a>[24]</a></sup><ul>\\n<li>\\n<a>ARM 1176 32-Bit Core Processor</a><ul>\\n<li>ARMv6 Instruction Set</li>\\n<li>667Mhz (underclocked to 412Mhz to prevent overheating)<sup><a>[25]</a></sup>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>128MB SDRAM</li>\\n<li>Integrated PowerVR MBX Lite Graphics Card</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>Samsung K9MCG08 (NOR/NAND Flash Storage)</li>\\n<li>Marvell W8686 (Wi-Fi)</li>\\n<li>CSR BlueCore4 (Bluetooth)</li>\\n<li>\\n<span>Infineon</span> S-Gold-2 (Phone, Messages, and Cellular Data)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2><span>References</span></h2>\\n<div><div><ol>\\n<li>\\n<span><a>↑</a></span> <span>Honan, Mathew. \"<a>Apple unveils iPhone</a>\", <a>Macworld</a>, January 9, 2007.

He was convicted of falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment to porn star <a>Stormy Daniels</a> ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump is the first former U.S. president convicted of a crime.\\xa0\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Prosecutors <a>charged Trump</a> with falsifying business records. They alleged Trump falsified the records to conceal unlawfully interfering in the 2016 presidential election through the $130,000 hush money payment, making the falsification charges felonies.\\xa0The crime carries a penalty of up to four years in prison, with sentencing scheduled for July 11, but legal experts previously <a>told USA TODAY</a> the presumptive Republican nominee is likely to get <a>only probation or a shorter sentence</a>.</p>\\n<p><a>Trump called</a> the outcome a \"disgrace\" and vowed to keep fighting his conviction.</p>\\n<p>The more-than <a>six weeks-long trial</a> against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee − which featured dramatic clashes between lawyers and witnesses, the judge and Trump − was the first criminal trial in U.S. history against a former president.</p>\\n<p>Trump\\'s conviction marks another historic moment, with an uncertain impact on the 2024 presidential election.\\xa0He is <a>not disqualified</a> from running for office and while polls have suggested a conviction would harm his prospects, <a>prominent Republican supporters</a> quickly rallied to his side.</p>\\n<p><strong>Prep for the polls:</strong> <a>See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide</a></p>\\n<p>Follow along with USA TODAY\\'s live coverage here:</p>\\n<h2>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg: \\'I did my job\\'</h2>\\n<p><a>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg</a> said he did not have any response to <a>Donald Trump’s repeated attacks</a> on the prosecutor and his staff, but he praised his office.</p>\\n<p>“I did my job. Our job is to follow the facts and the law without fear or favor. That’s exactly what we did here,” Bragg said. “I did my job. We did our job. Many voices out there. The only voice that matters is the voice of the jury and the jury has spoken.”</p>\\n<p><em>− Bart Jansen</em></p>\\n<h2>Will Donald Trump go to jail?</h2>\\n<p><a>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg</a> dodged a question about whether he would seek jail time when Trump is sentenced July 11.</p>\\n<p>“We will speak at that time,” Bragg said.</p>\\n<p>Bragg also declined to say whether he would oppose a request from Trump to remain free while he appeals the verdict. Bragg said prosecutors would respond formally at sentencing July 11.</p>\\n<p>“I’m going to let our words in court speak for themselves,” Bragg said.</p>\\n<p><em>− Bart Jansen</em></p>\\n<h2><strong>Trump still faces criminal prosecution in these other three cases</strong></h2>\\n<p>With Donald Trump <a>guilty on all charges</a> in his Manhattan hush money trial, he still faces criminal charges in three other cases, including two for allegedly trying to illegally steal the 2020 election he lost to <a>President Joe Biden.</a></p>\\n<p>In all, Trump faced a combined 88 criminal counts, including the 34 in Manhattan that he was convicted of Thursday by a jury. That <a>leaves 54 counts between the three other cases,</a> two of them in federal court that were brought by special counsel Jack Smith on behalf of the Justice Department.</p>\\n<p>One of those involves the retention of classified documents. The other federal case overseen by Smith accuses Trump of trying to subvert the 2020 election results.</p>\\n<p>The fourth case, in Fulton County, Ga., accuses Trump and 14 co-defendants − including some of his former lawyers, and administration aides − of trying to overturn Trump\\'s loss in the Peach State in 2020.</p>\\n<p>Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases. None of them have trial dates scheduled, and legal experts largely concur that it\\'s unlikely that any will begin before election day on Nov. 5, a likely rematch between Biden and Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0<em>−Josh Meyer</em></p>\\n<h2>Watch DA Alvin Bragg\\'s press conference live</h2>\\n<p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. will hold a press conference Thursday evening following the\\xa0<a>conviction of Donald Trump.</a></p>\\n<p>The press conference is scheduled to be held at 6:30 p.m. ET at the 8th Floor Training Room in New York, the DA\\'s office said in a release.</p>\\n<p>You can <a>watch his comments live here.</a></p>\\n<p><em>− Anthony Robledo</em></p>\\n<h2><strong>What was Trump found guilty of?</strong></h2>\\n<p>Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records.</p>\\n<p>Each count is tied to a different business record that prosecutors argued Trump was responsible for changing in order to either conceal or <a>commit another crime</a>.</p>\\n<p>Those records include 11 checks paid to former lawyer\\xa0<a>Michael Cohen</a>, 11 invoices from Cohen and 12 entries in Trump\\'s ledgers.</p>\\n<p>The jury found that Trump authorized a plan to reimburse Cohen for the $130,000 hush money payment issued to\\xa0<a>Stormy Daniels</a> and spread the payments across 12 months disguised as legal expenses.</p>\\n<p><em>− Kinsey Crowley</em></p>\\n<h2>\\'Trump is in a deep hole here\\': Former federal prosecutor reacts to verdict</h2>\\n<p>Kevin O’Brien, a former federal prosecutor now practicing at Ford O’Brien Landy, said Trump could appeal whether the<a>evidence was sufficient to convict him</a>. But Trump can no longer challenge the credibility of witnesses such as former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actress Stormy Daniels because the jury believed them, O’Brien said.</p>\\n<p>“Trump is in a deep hole here,” O’Brien said. “It’s not like he gets to start over. That’s not how the appeal system works.”</p>\\n<p>The\\xa0jury weighed the evidence and decided that witnesses such as<a>former lawyer Michael Cohen</a> and porn actress Stormy Daniels were credible.</p>\\n<p>The counts each carry maximum sentences of four years, but legal experts say Judge Juan Merchan could give him probation or a shorter sentence as a first-time offender to a non-violent offense. The felony convictions don’t prohibit Trump from campaigning or potentially winning the White House.</p>\\n<p>“He could still easily wind up president of the United States,” O’Brien said. “There’s nothing that would prevent that from happening.”</p>\\n<p><em>− Bart Jansen</em></p>\\n<h2>Can Trump run for president now?</h2>\\n<p>Yes, even after being convicted on felony counts, the Thursday verdict does not impact Donald Trump\\'s ability to <a>seek another term in the White House.</a> The Constitution is pretty clear − here are the qualifications to serve as president.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Be a natural-born citizen of the U.S.</li>\\n<li>Have lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years</li>\\n<li>Be at least 35 years old</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>− Marina Pitofsky</em></p>\\n<h2>\\n<strong>What happens to Trump now?</strong> <strong>Trump sentencing date</strong>\\n</h2>\\n<p>Judge <a>Juan Merchan</a> has scheduled Trump\\'s sentencing for July 11, and Trump is out free until then.</p>\\n<p>Because this is Trump\\'s first felony offense, his sentence is likely to be as light as probation or home confinement. If he does receive a<a>sentence</a>, it would probably be less than a year.</p>\\n<p>Trump is likely to appeal the conviction. That would push any jailtime until after the election.</p>\\n<p><em>− Kinsey Crowley</em>\\xa0</p>\\n<h2>Who were the key witnesses in Donald Trump\\'s historic trial</h2>\\n<p><a>Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen</a> was a significant witness testifying that he submitted invoices for “legal expenses” that Trump knew were to reimburse him for paying $130,000 to silence porn actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. But Trump lawyer Todd Blanche accused Cohen of lying on the stand when he testified he notified Trump about the payment to Daniels. In closing arguments, Blanche called Cohenthe “MVP of liars” and “the embodiment of reasonable doubt.”\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, described the alleged sexual encounter in enough detail that Merchan questioned why defense lawyers didn’t object more to block her testimony. Trump has repeatedly denied he had sex with Daniels and Blanche argued the payment “started out as an extortion” whether the allegation was true or not.</p>\\n<p>David Pecker, the former CEO of American Media Inc., which owned the National Enquirer, said he agreed in a meeting with Trump and Cohen in August 2015 to be the “eyes and ears” of Trump’s presidential campaign to buy negative stories about the candidate and never publish them.</p>\\n<p>Pecker acknowledged paying former Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 for her story and then refusing to pay for Daniels because Trump hadn’t reimbursed him. <a>Cohen provided a recording</a>, which prosecutor Joshua Steinglass called “jaw-dropping,” of Trump mentioning the $150,000 figure.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><em>− Bart Jansen</em></p>\\n<h2>Can Trump go to prison?</h2>\\n<p>Yes. Each felony count of falsifying business records − elevated to a felony because prosecutors proved their purpose was to commit or conceal another crime − carries a maximum sentence of four years. However, New York caps such sentencing the type of felonies Trump faced – Class E felonies –\\xa0<a>at 20 years</a>.</p>\\n<p>But given Trump doesn\\'t have a criminal record and wasn\\'t convicted of a violent crime, such a high sentence is very unlikely, according to legal experts. <a>Several spoke to USA TODAY</a> ahead of the trial about what could happen if Trump were convicted. Nearly all predicted that, if convicted, Trump would get a sentence ranging from just probation to up to four years in prison, and likely falling within the lower end of that range.</p>\\n<p><em>− Aysha Bagchi</em></p>\\n<h2>Donald Trump reacts to guilty verdict</h2>\\n<p>Donald Trump quickly reacted to the jury\\'s decision finding him guilty on all 34 criminal counts.</p>\\n<p>“This is just a disgrace,” Trump told reporters in the hallway outside the courtroom. “We didn’t do anything wrong. I’m an innocent man.”</p>\\n<p>Trump ignored shouted questions about whether he would drop out of the presidential campaign.</p>\\n<p>“This is long from over,” Trump said. “We’ll keep fighting. We’ll fight to the end and we’ll win.”</p>\\n<p><em>− Bart Jansen</em></p>\\n<h2>People surrounding courthouse react</h2>\\n<p>Outside the courthouse, anti-Trump demonstrators cheered and drivers honked their horns as news of the guilty verdicts spread. “Guilty!” several people shouted out.</p>\\n<p><em>− David Jackson</em></p>\\n<h2>Jury reaches a verdict</h2>\\n<p>The jury has reached a verdict in former President <a>Donald Trump</a>\\'s New York <a>criminal hush money trial</a>, which centers on allegations that he falsified business records to hide a hush money payment to porn star <a>Stormy Daniels</a> ahead of the 2016 presidential election.</p>\\n<p>Jurors confirmed that they had reached a verdict in a note signed by the foreperson at 4:20 p.m. local time.

Depending on how much data you have to re-download, including music and apps, it might take a while.</p>\\n<h2><span>What if you don\\'t have a physical SIM card?</span></h2>\\n<p>Purchased an iPhone 14 or newer? You\\'ll notice your new iPhone doesn\\'t have a physical SIM card at all (if you\\'re in the US) and instead you need to set your device up with an eSIM. This makes things so much easier but if you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing lear more with our <a>how to use an eSIM on iPhone guide</a>.</p>\\n<h2><span>Is a backup right for you?</span></h2>\\n<p>Personally, I opt to set all my Apple devices up as new every time I upgrade to a newer device. The reason I choose to do this is because by the end of my iPhone\\'s lifespan, the device is usually cluttered with more applications than I could ever need. By opting to set up as new, with my iCloud settings backed up and iCloud Photos enabled, I have a nice spring clean and a fresh new device with all my settings and photos. This also helps remove the possibility of bugs causing issues like the <a>overheating problems in the iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> reported by some users.</p>\\n<p>For many, restoring from a backup isn\\'t the way to go, and if you\\'re somewhat like me, then I highly advise thinking about this option, particularly if your iPhone is cluttered. If you know what you store on <a>iCloud</a>, then you can have a new iPhone that feels like a new device rather than an exact copy of your old one.\\xa0This option isn\\'t for everyone, but it\\'s something to think about if you value clean and fresh over all your \"stuff.\" For many though you want to transfer data from iPhone to iPhone.</p>\\n<h3><span>One More Thing... Important data and old tech</span></h3>\\n<p>Our iPhones are time capsules, holding beautiful memories and critical data right in the palm of our hands. If you\\'ve never transferred data from iPhone to iPhone before, this can feel daunting, and the prospect of losing precious information always lingers. Personally, I use iCloud Photo Library and Files on iCloud to make sure all my data is safe without relying on a backup. As I have everything important backed up on iCloud, I always opt to set up devices as new. While that process isn\\'t for everyone, you have many options to choose from in how you decide to transfer data from iPhone to iPhone.</p>\\n<p>If you opt for a wired transfer, you\\'ll want to make sure that you have the right cable for the job, especially with the iPhone 15\\'s move to USB-C. Though Apple doesn\\'t give you an <a>iPhone charger</a> anymore, it still provides a basic USB-C to Lightning cable in the box for older devices and a braided USB-C cable for brand-new iPhones.</p>\\n<p>Once you\\'ve moved your data from one iPhone to the other, you may be wondering what you should do with your old tech. This depends on the model of your old device and the value it holds on the resell market. If you\\'ve got a very old device, you can look into recycling by taking your device to an Apple Store. However, if you own a device that still holds some value, definitely look into <a>Apple Trade In</a>.</p>\\n<p>Ultimately, if you have already bought your new iPhone, it may be worth hanging onto your old one as a backup. With iPhones launching every September, if you happen to break yours in August or July, you may be thankful for that old bit of tech to save you from having to wait months for your next upgrade.</p>\\n<div><div>\\n<div><div>Anker USB-C to Lightning Cable 3FT MFi Certified</div></div>\\n<div>\\n<aside><div><div><div><div>\\n<div><div>\\n<a><div><span>$9.99</span></div></a><a>at Amazon</a>\\n</div></div>\\n<div><div>\\n<a><div><span>$10.99</span></div></a><a>at anker</a>\\n</div></div>\\n<div><div>\\n<a><div><span>$24.99</span></div></a><a>at Verizon Wireless</a>\\n</div></div>\\n</div></div></div></div></aside><p>Anker is a brand that is well known for quality power accessories, and this is an excellent USB-C to Lightning cable for your iPhone needs, whether it\\'s charging or data transfer.</p>\\n</div>\\n</div></div>\\n<div><div>\\n<div><div>Nomad Universal USB-C Cable</div></div>\\n<div>\\n<aside><div><div><div><div><div><div><a>View at Nomad</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></aside><p>Likely the last cable you\\'ll need to buy, this universal braided Kevlar cable is made to last and future-proof.

CEO <a>Steve Jobs</a> <a>unveils the iPhone</a>—a touchscreen mobile phone with an iPod, camera and Web-browsing capabilities, among other features—at the Macworld convention in <a>San Francisco</a>. Jobs, dressed in his customary jeans and black mock turtleneck, called the iPhone a “revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone.” When it went on sale in the United States six months later, on June 29, amidst huge hype, thousands of customers lined up at Apple stores across the country to be among the first to purchase an iPhone.</p>\\n<p>In November 2007—by which point more than 1.4 million iPhones had been sold—Time magazine named the sleek, 4.8-ounce device, originally available in a 4GB, $499 model and an 8GB, $599 model, its invention of the year. The iPhone went on sale in parts of Europe in late 2007, and in parts of Asia in 2008. In July 2008, Apple launched its online App Store, enabling people to download software applications that let them use their iPhones for games, social networking, travel planning and an every growing laundry list of other activities. Apple went on to over 10 updated models of the iPhone.</p>\\n<p>The iPhone helped turned Apple, which Jobs (1955-2011) co-founded with his friend Stephen Wozniak in <a>California</a> in 1976, into one of the planet’s most valuable corporations. In 2012, five years after the iPhone’s debut, more than 200 million had been sold. The iPhone joined a list of innovative Apple products, including the Macintosh (launched in 1984, it was one of the first personal computers to feature a graphical user interface, which allowed people to navigate by pointing and clicking a mouse rather than typing commands) and the iPod portable music player (launched in 2001), that became part of everyday modern life.</p>\\n</div>\\n<footer><div><div><div>\\n<div><p><span>By:</span><a>History.com Editors</a></p></div>\\n<div><p><a>HISTORY.com</a> works with a wide range of writers and editors to create accurate and informative content.

and in the third part of our Psychology of Shopping series, we hear her story.</p>\\n<p>Maddy says she didn\\'t tell anyone about her out-of-control spending.</p>\\n<p>\"I knew what I was doing was wrong but I felt really ashamed of the fact I was just spending money all the time,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>Only her housemates knew she was struggling because she was unable to pay the bills, but even they didn\\'t know the true extent of her debt and Maddy found herself \"hiding\" from them because she owed them money.</p>\\n<p>Miles from home and feeling alone, Maddy stopped speaking to her parents for a long time as she felt \"ashamed\" and didn\\'t want them to \"bear the burden of having to bail me out\".</p>\\n<p>All the while her spending sprees continued.</p>\\n<p>Maddy explains that much of it was borne out of wanting people to like her - she thought if she had the trendiest clothes and was going out drinking then she\\'d be popular.</p>\\n<p>But she\\'d wake up hungover from a night out and \"spiral\", then go out and buy more clothes.</p>\\n<p>When the debt became too overwhelming, she stopped opening her post and moved to a different city in an attempt to get away from it.</p>\\n<p>It even got to the point where a bailiff turned up at her house, which she described as a \"horrible situation\".</p>\\n<p>In desperation she turned to the Citizen\\'s Advice Bureau, which told her she would have to go bankrupt - an idea that only filled her with \"more shame\".</p>\\n<p>It was then that Maddy decided to finally sort things out.</p>\\n<p>Citizen\\'s Advice told her about the 50-30-20 rule - where you spend\\xa050% of your incomings on rent and everyday bills, 30% on wants and needs, and 20% on debt.</p>\\n<p>Given it would still have taken her about 60 years to clear her debt this way, Maddy says instead she adopted her own 50-10-40 rule - which gave her just 10% of her incomings for food and socialising.</p>\\n<p>She was living on just £15 a week for food so learned to pick up only yellow sticker deals from the supermarket, which would lead to some \"random\" meals.</p>\\n<p>\"I discovered I really love tinned tomatoes on toast with cheese so I lived on that solidly for about two years,\" Maddy says.</p>\\n<p>Now, Maddy has launched an app called <a>Mad About Money</a> to help others - particularly those who are neurodivergent - achieve their money and wellbeing goals.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>She says if she had been taught about money at a young age, she would\\'ve realised the \"massive consequences\" of her spending.</p>\\n<p>\"The whole reason I set up the app is to give people that education and a support community - if they don’t want to talk to their friends, they can come and talk to people who are in similar situations so everyone can cheer each other on,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>\"If other people had said to me, we\\'re in the same position, we\\'re doing the same thing, I wouldn\\'t have felt as ashamed about it.\"</p>\\n<p>Looking back on what happened to her, she says it\\'s \"part of my story so I don\\'t regret it\" and it has taught her a lot, though she does regret putting her parents under stress and not talking to them sooner.</p>\\n<p>She now talks openly with her children about money so they can make more educated decisions.</p>\\n<p>As for the urge to spend money so that people like her?</p>\\n<p>\"I\\'ve loads of friends now - I rock up in joggers half the time and they don\\'t care,\" she laughs.</p>\\n<p><b>Join us tomorrow as we conclude this series with a look at the tactics big brands use to get you to spend more</b></p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div><time><div>06:11:33</div></time></div>\\n<div>\\n<div>Top chef shares his take on an Italian classic</div>\\n<div>\\n<p><b>Every Wednesday we ask Michelin chefs to pick their favourite Cheap Eats where they live and when they cook at home.\\xa0This week we speak to\\xa0Richard Craven from one-starred\\xa0<a>The Royal Oak</a> in Warwickshire.\\xa0</b></p>\\n<p><b>Hi Richard</b><b>, c</b><b>an you tell us your favourite places in Warwickshire</b><b>where you can get a meal for two for less than £40?</b></p>\\n<p>I have two great local spots, one for brunch and one for dinner. They both support sustainable and regenerative farming and use the brilliant Tamworth pork from our neighbour Paddock Farm.</p>\\n<p>For brunch or lunch it has to be <a>The Straw Kitchen at Whichford Pottery</a>. The kitchen offers classic brunch dishes with homemade relishes and home-grown leaves and super interesting and healthy salads with a great range of meaty and vegetarian options. My go-to treat would be the bacon sandwich.</p>\\n<p>The second is <b><a>The Copper Grill</a></b>, which recently opened within our local, The Black Horse, Shipston-on-Stour. The burgers are incredible.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>The bacon double-cheese burger is my favourite, but there are a great range that pair well with the selection of beers that the landlord, Gabe, keeps.</p>\\n<p>Living in the countryside with a sparse population means we don\\'t have a lot of fast-food options, so to find something independently owned and a massive cut above the chains makes this a winner.</p>\\n<p><b>What\\'s your go-to cheap meal at home?</b></p>\\n<p>I trained under Italian chefs at the start of my career, so pasta has always been a favourite fast food for me.</p>\\n<p>At this time of year, it would have to be wild garlic pesto, with either fresh or dried supermarket pasta.</p>\\n<p>Throw a couple handfuls of wild garlic leaves into a food processor, with a handful of both walnuts and pine nuts that have been toasted, a handful of parmesan or an English alternative, such as Old Winchester, and blend with a glug of olive oil. Toss with the cooked pasta and it\\'s done.</p>\\n<p>I usually do a larger batch and keep it in an airtight jar in the fridge.</p>\\n<p><b>How did you get into cheffing?</b></p>\\n<p>I went to school in Chipping Campden and started washing up in kitchens, simply because it was warmer and better paid than my paper round.</p>\\n<p>I quickly realised if everything was clean and tidy, I would get something more interesting to do and that was the spark.</p>\\n<p>I really loved the environment and ended up going full time at 18.</p>\\n<p><b>We\\'ve spoken to lots of top chefs and bloggers - check out their Cheap Eats from around the country here...</b></p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div><time><div>06:04:51</div></time></div>\\n<div>\\n<div>Analysis: Enjoy the boost to your holiday pound while you can</div>\\n<div>\\n<p>If, as expected, the European Central Bank cuts its main policy rate tomorrow it will be a hugely significant moment.</p>\\n<p>At a very basic level, the cut - the ECB is expected to trim its deposit rate from 4% to 3.75% - should benefit millions of households and businesses across the eurozone, who have never known interest rates this high since the single currency was born 25 years ago.</p>\\n<p>British tourists venturing to the usual summer hotspots should also benefit as the pound could grow against the euro, though it is fair to say the foreign exchange markets have been pricing in a rate cut for a while. The pound has risen by 1.5% against the euro since mid-April.</p>\\n<p>But the move will be significant in terms of what it says about central banks around the world. It will be the first time in relatively normal circumstances since before the Ukraine war in which the ECB (or the Bundesbank, the most important central bank in Europe prior to European monetary union) has cut before the US Fed.</p>\\n<p>It is important to note at this point that the ECB is far from being the only central bank whose monetary policy is diverging away from that of the Fed - those in Sweden and Switzerland have done so, and Canada is expected to do so today. In the UK, the Bank of England is expected to begin cutting interest rates in August while the Fed, by contrast, is now not expected to begin cutting until the final three months of the year.</p>\\n<p>Divergence in monetary policy from the Federal Reserve does not come without risks.</p>\\n<p>In particular, there will be concerns about what an early ECB rate cut will mean for the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar. All other things being equal, it should weaken the single currency, making the price of exports from the eurozone to the US more competitive.</p>\\n<p>However, that comes with risks, not least in terms of pushing up the cost of imports - particularly energy, which is priced in dollars, which could in turn push up inflation. A weaker euro would also carry risks in a US election year in which both Joe Biden and Donald Trump, his challenger, will be seeking to out-bid each other with protectionist policies.</p>\\n<p>As Mohamed El-Erian, adviser to Allianz and Gramercy and one of the world\\'s most experienced investors, wrote in the Financial Times last week: \"Too large and persistent a\\xa0divergence\\xa0in rates risks weakening European currencies beyond the point where possible competitive advantages compensate for the costs of higher imported inflation.</p>\\n<p>\"In a US election year, this could also fan protectionist tendencies that, already, are on the cusp of intensifying. The two together would risk financial instability that would spill back to amplify economic concerns.\"</p>\\n<p>For that reason, most market-watchers do not expect this divergence in monetary policy to extend too far. Strategists at BlackRock, the world\\'s biggest asset manager, told clients in a note this week: \"Falling inflation and 18 months of weak economic activity make the case for the ECB to start cutting rates. But we don\\'t think it will cut far and fast.</p>\\n<p>\"Likewise in the US, we see just one or two Fed cuts this year. This is not your typical rate-cutting cycle.</p>\\n<p>\"Investors may see opportunities in further policy divergence, but we think it will be temporary as both central banks ultimately keep rates high for longer.\"</p>\\n<p>So the message for households and businesses in the eurozone is this - while your borrowing costs are about to come down, they may not come down as much as you would like them to.</p>\\n<p>That also applies to Britons hitting the sun-loungers in Spain, Greece and elsewhere this summer.

I was giving birth in February 2021, so I had a timeline, but I delivered my last project five days before I gave birth,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>So far, the company hasn\\'t taken any outside investment and Jenn still hasn\\'t drawn a salary matching what she used to earn.</p>\\n<p>\"We\\'re going on a slower trajectory at the moment but finances are always tough on your business,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>\"You get these waves of great business, you\\'re making money and then you have your downtime, so it\\'s about starting and making sure you review your finances enough that you understand when those waves are going to happen.\"</p>\\n<p><b>Four-day week and championing women</b></p>\\n<p>While focusing on sustainability, Cyd Connects has also centred itself on building a working environment built for women by women, and has invested in a four-day 32-hour work week for all staff.</p>\\n<p>It also offers discounts to companies that are majority owned by women or an under-served group.</p>\\n<p>\"I faced a lot of barriers in my career because I\\'m an Asian woman and people don\\'t realise they\\'re being biased towards women,\" Jenn says.</p>\\n<p>\"If the majority of your workforce is women, but then all of a sudden senior leadership is not, there\\'s a reason why that\\'s happening.</p>\\n<p>\"A lot of businesses aren\\'t really willing to face that yet, and we really wanted to become a champion for women. It\\'s really important for me. I have a daughter, I want things to change for the future.\"</p>\\n<p><b>The challenges</b></p>\\n<p>Like any business, setting up Cyd Connects has come with its challenges, and Jenn says being a woman was part of that.</p>\\n<p>\"I think a lot of women have imposter syndrome. When I started the business, I didn\\'t even call myself CEO at first,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>\"I was like, should I call myself a CEO? I really had to take that thinking away and say I am running this business. I am a CEO.\"</p>\\n<p>Another obstacle came from the bias around women\\'s financial knowledge.</p>\\n<p>\"I had worked in marketing for a long time, and I was often told by the CEOs and finance directors that I didn\\'t understand the finances well enough,\" Jenn says.</p>\\n<p>\"I think women are often told that they don\\'t know them and that is a kind of bias against us because we can understand finances as well as anyone.\"</p>\\n<p>She adds: \"You don\\'t realise that it\\'s happening in the moment... But actually, when I look back, I realise that it was just an easy thing to say to me, to not promote me into a position.\"</p>\\n<p><b>Jenn\\'s advice</b></p>\\n<p>While every woman can run a business, Jenn says, those who are successful need to have a real passion for what they\\'re doing - and be realistic.</p>\\n<p>\"It\\'s a lot of work. It\\'s hard and you\\'re not getting paid for that hard work,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>\"No one starts a business and is just making tonnes of money.\"</p>\\n<p>Another tip is to be prepared mentally and organised in your personal life.</p>\\n<p>\"You can definitely do it, you just need to get yourself ready for it,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>Lastly, part of the process means you have to just \"go with the flow\".</p>\\n<p>\"Things are going to go up and down. It\\'s going to be quite a journey,\" she says.</p>\\n<p>\"But as long as you are realise that\\'s going to happen and you\\'re open to it, I feel like you can really fly with starting a business.\"</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div><time><div>10:55:45</div></time></div>\\n<div>\\n<div>How much the M&amp;S and Sainsbury\\'s bosses earn</div>\\n<div>\\n<p>Company records have revealed the bosses of M&amp;S and Sainsbury\\'s were paid about £5m each last year.</p>\\n<p>M&amp;S chief executive Stuart Machin received a record £4.73m payout - a 75% increase on his earnings the previous year.</p>\\n<p>Of this, £908,000 was fixed pay while the rest was performance-related.</p>\\n<p>Co-chief executive Katie Bickerstaffe, who has a four-day working pattern, took home a £4.41m payout.</p>\\n<p>Her earnings were 85% higher than last year.</p>\\n<p>The pair have overseen a successful turnaround for the retailer, which saw its profits surge by 58% in the 52 weeks to 30 March.</p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, Sainsbury\\'s chief executive Simon Roberts took home £4.91m in the last year - a dip of 5.8% on last year\\'s payout.</p>\\n<p>Mr Roberts\\'s base salary increased by 3.8% to £933,000, but his bonus decreased.</p>\\n<p>Sainsbury\\'s saw its pre-tax profit rise by 1.6%.</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div></section>\\n</div></div>\\n</div>\\n</div></div></main><footer><h2>Sky News footer</h2>\\n<div>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li><a><span>Facebook</span></a></li>\\n<li><a><span>X</span></a></li>\\n<li><a><span>YouTube</span></a></li>\\n<li><a><span>Instagram</span></a></li>\\n</ul></div>\\n<div>\\n<section><h3>About Sky News</h3>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li><a>About Us</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News Profiles</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News International</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News Library Sales</a></li>\\n<li><a>Site Map</a></li>\\n<li><a>Editorial Guidelines</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News Board</a></li>\\n</ul></div></section><section><h3>Sky News Services</h3>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li><a>Sky News RSS</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News For Your Phone</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News Radio</a></li>\\n</ul></div></section><section><h3>Sky Channels</h3>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li><a>Sky Witness</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Atlantic</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Arts</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Cinema</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Sports</a></li>\\n</ul></div></section><section><h3>More Sky Sites</h3>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li><a>NOW</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Zero</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Academy Studios</a></li>\\n<li><a>Bigger Picture</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Group</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky Bet</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky.com</a></li>\\n<li><a>Sky News Arabia</a></li>\\n<li><a>Advertise With Us</a></li>\\n</ul></div></section>\\n</div>\\n<div><ul>\\n<li><a>Terms &amp; Conditions</a></li>\\n<li><a>Privacy &amp; Cookies</a></li>\\n<li><a>Privacy Options</a></li>\\n<li><a>Accessibility</a></li>\\n<li><a>Contact Us</a></li>\\n</ul></div>\\n<div><span>© 2024 Sky UK</span></div>\\n</div></footer>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n',\n",

The device, which didn’t actually go on sale until June, started at $499 for a 4GB model, $599 for the 8GB version (with a two-year contract). It offered a 3.5-in. screen, a 2-megapixel camera and won plaudits for the then-new multitouch features. Critics, however, said the phone was too expensive to do well in the market.

The new model could connect to faster 3G-based networks, included built-in GPS, offered more storage and was cheaper. Selling for $199 for the 8GB model, $299 for the 16GB version, the iPhone 3G was available on July 11, and offered something called location services. “Location services is going to be a really big deal on the iPhone,” said CEO Steve Jobs. “It’s going to explode.” (See launch story.)</p>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><div><div>\\n<h2>iPhone 3GS</h2>\\n<figure> <small>IDG / Apple</small><figcaption><p>Apple’s iPhone 3Gs arrived in June 2009.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Again at WWDC, Apple’s Steve Jobs announced the next iPhone, a faster version called <a>the iPhone 3GS</a>. Although the form factor was unchanged from the previous version, the new iPhone was twice as fast as its predecessor and ran iPhone 3.0 (an early version of iOS 8, due out later this month). The 32GB iPhone 3G S sold for $299; a 16GB model went for $199. An 8GB iPhone 3G was also offered for $99. The iPhone 3GS was available June 19, 2009.

Prices remained unchanged: $199 for a 16GB model and $299 for the 32GB version. It went on sale on June 24, and heralded the arrival of the first high-resolution “Retina” screen. “Once you use a Retina Display, you can’t go back,” said Steve Jobs.

New CEO Tim Cook talked up the new phone’s dual-core processor (the same used in the iPad 2), and said the 4S would go on sale Oct. 14. In addition to the usual 16GB and 32GB models, Apple also unveiled a 64GB version that sold for $399. (See launch story.)</p>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><div><div>\\n<h2>iPhone 5</h2>\\n<figure> <small>IDG / Apple</small><figcaption><p>Apple’s iPhone 5 arrived in September 2012.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 5, the first version to have a 4-in. screen, arrived on Sept. 12, 2012, as CEO Tim Cook touted the faster, slimmer upgrade to the iPhone 4S during a 90-minute presentation in San Francisco. “This is the biggest thing to happen to iPhone since the [original] iPhone,” he said, referring to the first-gen smartphone Steve Jobs had launched in 2007. The iPhone 5 hit the streets on Sept. 21; prices for the 16GB, 32GB and 64GB models were unchanged. (See launch story.)</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 5S and 5C</h2>\\n<figure> <small>IDG / Apple</small><figcaption><p>Apple’s iPhone 5s and 5c arrived in September 2013.</p></figcaption></figure><p>On Sept. 10, 2013, Apple CEO Tim Cook rolled out not one, but two iPhones: <a>the upscale iPhone 5S</a> (now in gold, in addition to the usual white and black), and the colorful, less-expensive iPhone 5C. (The iPhone 5C was basically a reskinned iPhone 5.) The iPhone 5S got a faster, 64-bit A7 SoC (system on a chip), Touch ID, and a new motion data processor touted as the foundation for a new wave of health and fitness apps. The iPhone 5C started at $99 for a $16GB model; the iPhone 5S started at $199 for the same amount of storage. Both went on sale Sept. 20.

Both iPhones sported new A8 processors that were faster and more efficient than the previous year’s models. Both also had upgraded cameras and were NFC-ready for access to the new Apple Pay network that rolled out in October. Although the iPhone 6 was priced the same as 2013’s iPhone 5S, the Plus model was $100 more.

The 6S and 6S plus got new force touch technology called 3D Touch, as well as a beefed up 12-megapixel iSight camera that shot 4K video. (The 5-megapixel FaceTime camera was also new, and was designed to take better selfies.) Both phones ran on a faster A9 chip, and came in a new color for 2015: rose gold. (See launch story.)</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 7 and 7 Plus</h2>\\n<figure> <small>IDG / Apple</small><figcaption><p>Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were released in September 2016.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 7 and <a>7 Plus</a> looked much like the 2015 models, with three major exceptions: Apple eliminated the audio jack, changed the home button into a haptic-based virtual button, and added a dual-camera setup in the 7S. The loss of the audio jack, a somewhat controversial move, meant users had to rely on the Apple-supplied earbuds or use their old headphones with the included adapter. Both phones ran on a quad-core A10 Fusion chip, and came in two new colors: Black (a matte-finish charcoal color) and the super shiny Jet Black.

The front and back glass enclosure, which Apple said was the most durable glass ever in a smartphone, was reminiscent of the design of the iPhone 4 and 4s. True Tone technology adjusted the white balance of the display to match the surrounding light. Redesigned stereo speakers were 25% louder and delivered deeper bass.</p>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><div><div>\\n<p>Apple called the A11 Bionic chip “the most powerful and smartest chip ever in a smartphone.” It featured a six-core CPU with two performance cores and four efficiency cores, which were 25% and 70% faster than the A10 Fusion chip, respectively. The new iPhones included an Apple-designed GPU that delivered up to 30% faster graphics than in 2016’s iPhone 7.</p>\\n<p>Each model featured an improved 12-megapixel camera with a larger (and faster) sensor, a new color filter, deeper pixels, and capabilities for 4K video up to 60fps and 1080p slo-mo up to 240fps. ARKit in iOS 11 allowed developers to create AR games and apps offering immersive and fluid experiences. Color variations included space gray, silver, and a new version of gold.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone X</h2>\\n<figure> <small>IDG / Apple</small><figcaption><p>Apple’s iPhone X arrived in November 2017.</p></figcaption></figure><p>To commemorate a decade of iPhones, Apple ended its <a>September event</a> with “one more thing,” <a>the iPhone X</a> (“ten”). Starting at $999 for 64GB and $1,149 for 256GB, it was Apple’s most expensive iPhone to date. It included a redesigned glass and stainless steel enclosure, wireless charging, and dual cameras. Its flagship feature was an edge-to-edge “Super Retina display” — a 5.8-in. OLED display that supports Dolby Vision and HDR 10. It had a pixel resolution of 458ppi, a 1 million-to-1 contrast ratio, and True Tone.</p>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><div><div>\\n<p>Touch ID and the Home button were removed in favor of a new biometric security feature: Face ID. Face ID uses a TrueDepth camera system made up of a dot projector, infrared camera and flood illuminator. The A11 Bionic chip works in tandem with advanced depth-sensing technologies to map and recognize a user’s face to securely unlock the iPhone or make a transaction with Apple Pay. Face ID only works when a user looks at the iPhone X directly and is designed to prevent spoofing by photos and masks.</p>\\n<p>The 7-megapixel TrueDepth front-facing camera that enables Face ID also included auto image stabilization and delivered Portrait mode for better selfies with a depth-of-field effect.\\xa0The TrueDepth camera also could animate emoji, which Apple playfully calls Animoji. The dual 12-megapixel rear camera included dual optical image stabilization, and an improved f/2.4 aperature on the telephoto lens.</p>\\n<p>According to Apple, the A11 Bionic neural engine performed up to 600 billion operations per second and was designed for specific machine learning algorithms, enabling Face ID, Animoji, and other features. Colors included silver and space gray.</p>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><div><div>\\n<h2>iPhone Xr</h2>\\n<figure> <small>IDG / Apple</small><figcaption><p>Apple’s iPhone Xr arrived in October 2018.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The Xr had an aluminum-and-glass design in six finishes, with improved water resistance and a 6.1-in. “Liquid Retina” display. Available in 64GB, 128GB and 256GB models and starting at $749, it featured Apple’s A12 Bionic Chip with second-generation Neural Engine — the first 7-nanometer chip in a smartphone.</p>\\n<p>Portrait mode with depth control was available on the TrueDepth camera for selfies, which included support for Memoji and face tracking for Face ID authentication, while the 12-megapixel camera with an f/1.8-aperture wide-angle lens featured a new sensor and improved software algorithms for faster focusing and enhanced portraiture with depth control. Established iPhone gestures were supported, and haptic touch controls could be used to instantly launch the camera or flashlight from the home screen.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone Xs and Xs Max</h2>\\n<figure> <small>IDG / Apple</small><figcaption><p>Apple’s iPhone Xs and Xs Max arrived in September 2018.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Featuring 5.8- and 6.5-in. all-screen designs and improved scratch- and water-resistance, Apple’s iPhone Xs and Xs Max both offered Super Retina OLED displays that supported Dolby Vision and HDR10 and had iOS system-wide color management; the Xs Max had the largest iPhone display to date, with more than 3 million pixels, and the biggest battery — promising up to an hour and a half more battery life than the iPhone X.</p>\\n</div></div></div>\\n<div><div><div>\\n<p>The 12-megapixel dual-camera system offered advanced depth segmentation in Portrait mode with the ability to adjust depth of field both in preview and post-capture for precise control in portrait creation; the system allowed for faster face tracking for Face ID, Memoji, and third-party ARKit apps. Low-light performance and image stabilization were enhanced for both still photography and video capture, in addition to an extended dynamic range for better highlight and shadow detail. Four built-in mics could record stereo sound.</p>\\n<p>These models were the first to include Apple’s A12 Bionic Chip with second-generation Neural Engine. The chip design was capable of completing up to 5 trillion operations per second (compared with 600 billion in its predecessor). Models in 64GB, 256GB and 512GB configurations started at $999 and $1,099 for the Xs and Xs Max, respectively.</p>\\n<h2>iPhone 11</h2>\\n<figure> <small>IDG / Apple</small><figcaption><p>The iPhone 11 arrived in September 2019.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 11, which succeeded 2018’s iPhone XR, got a $50 price cut (to $699), a new color (purple), a redesigned two-camera system, and a number of under-the-hood technology upgrades.

For one thing, it was small, just 4.5 inches by 2.4 inches. By comparison, the iPhone XS Max launched in 2018 is 6.2 inches by 3.05 inches.</p></div>\\n<div><p>It also had no third-party apps whatsoever, and it topped out at 16GB of flash memory. The first iPhone was exclusive to AT&amp;T, and ran only on AT&amp;T\\'s notoriously slow and unreliable EDGE GSM network.</p></div>\\n<div><p>But despite all of its shortcomings, relative to today, that first iPhone was hugely important. It was Apple\\'s entry into a new category, at a time when the company\\'s singular handheld device was the iPod.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone was the debut of the touchscreen, which would soon become standard in the category. Sure, there had been smartphones available from established manufacturers before, but they had physical keyboards and a much smaller screen.</p></div>\\n<div>\\n<h2>Before the iPhone</h2> </div>\\n<div><p>In the fourth quarter of 2006, the year before the iPhone was announced, <a>22 million smartphones were sold worldwide</a>, according to Canalys data, and about half of those devices were by then-market leader Nokia. RIM, the BlackBerry maker, was second in share, followed by Motorola, Palm and Sony Ericsson. \\r</p></div>\\n<div><p>Smartphones at the time resembled the Motorola Q or the Samsung Blackjack —  a small, rectangular, handset, with a screen on top and buttons on the bottom. That began to change, however, in January 2007, when the first iPhone was announced.</p></div>\\n<div>\\n<h2>Nobody thought it could happen, or would succeed</h2> </div>\\n<div><p>The launch of the iPhone was greeted by quite a few doubters.</p></div>\\n<div><p>Then-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said in an interview at the time that the iPhone had \"no chance\" of taking over the smartphone market.</p></div>\\n<div><p>\"There\\'s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share,\" Ballmer told <em>USA Today</em> <a>in April of 2007</a>. No chance. It\\'s a $500 subsidized item. They may make a lot of money. But if you actually take a look at the 1.3 billion phones that get sold, I\\'d prefer to have our software in 60% or 70% or 80% of them, than I would to have 2% or 3%, which is what Apple might get.\" Ballmer admitted to <em>Bloomberg</em> in 2016 <a>that he had been wrong</a>, and that Microsoft had jumped into smarphones too late. \\r</p></div>\\n<div><p>Ballmer wasn\\'t alone. The then-CEOs of BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, watched the iPhone unveiling in disbelief. According to a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a>excerpt of \"Losing the Signal,\"</a> a book about RIM\\'s rise and fall, Lazaridis pointed out, accurately, that \"these guys are really, really good,\" while Balsillie said (not so accurately) that \"it\\'s OK—  we\\'ll be fine.\" \\r</p></div>\\n<div><p>There were doubters in the media, as well. \"<a>We Predict the iPhone Will Fail,\"</a> a <em>Techcrunch</em> contributor wrote. <em>TUAW</em> now <em>Engadget</em> <a>rounded up complaints about the phone</a>, with <a><em>AdAge</em></a> expecting the device to fail as well. \\r</p></div>\\n<div>\\n<h2>The rollout</h2> </div>\\n<div><p>Steve Jobs had reportedly eyed using touchscreens on Apple devices as early as 2005. Following <a>the failed experiment of the Motorola ROKR, a phone that came equipped with iTunes</a>, Apple decided to develop its own phone, which would incorporate the iPod\\'s musical functions into a smartphone. \\r</p></div>\\n<div><p>The iPhone was announced during <a>that year\\'s Macworld event in San Francisco</a>, on January 9, 2007. \\r</p></div>\\n<div><p>\"This is a day I\\'ve been looking forward to for two-and-a-half years,\" Jobs said in the keynote. He went on to point out the leading smartphones of the time —   the Motorola Q, the Palm Treo, the the Nokia E62, and the BlackBerry —   and to trash them, compared to his new product.</p></div>\\n<div><p>\"They all have these keyboards that are there, whether you need them or not to be there, and they all have these controls buttons that are fixed in plastic and are the same for every application.\" said Jobs. \"What we\\'re going to do is get rid of these buttons and replace them with a giant screen.\"</p></div>\\n<div><p>A few weeks later came the \"Hello\" commercial, which featured a succession of movie clips of characters answering telephones and saying \"hello\":</p></div>\\n<div>\\n<h2>The release</h2> </div>\\n<div><p>The original iPhone reached the market on June 29, 2007. In the U.S. it was priced at $499 and $599, for 4GB and 8GB models, respectively, along with a two-year contract with AT&amp;T.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The first iPhone ran on what was then called iPhone OS 1, as the iOS naming convention wouldn\\'t be adopted until 2010. It boasted only Apple\\'s native apps, as third-party applications wouldn\\'t be available until the App Store launched along with the iPhone 3G a year later.</p></div>\\n<div><p>The initial iPhone received mostly positive reviews.</p></div>\\n<div><p>\"As it turns out, much of the hype and some of the criticisms are justified,\" David Pogue wrote in the <em>New York Times</em>. \"The iPhone is revolutionary; it\\'s flawed. It\\'s substance; it\\'s style. It does things no phone has ever done before; it lacks features found even on the most basic phones.\"\\r</p></div>\\n<div><p>\"Despite some flaws and feature omissions, the iPhone is, on balance, a beautiful and breakthrough handheld computer,\" <a>Walter Mossberg wrote in <em>The Wall Street Journal\\'s All Things D</em>. </a> \"Its software, especially, sets a new bar for the smart-phone industry, and its clever finger-touch interface, which dispenses with a stylus and most buttons, works well, though it sometimes adds steps to common functions.\\r</p></div>\\n<div><p>Apple sold <a>1.9 million iPhones in 2007</a>, according to <em>Statista</em>. By contrast, they sold 216.76 million iPhones in 2017. It took Apple a few years to earn a dominant market position, as the device improved, it added more features, and it became both more affordable and available on more carriers. \\r</p></div>\\n<div><p>The iPod Touch, which brought an iPhone-style touchscreen to the iPod range, arrived later in 2007, while the iPad followed in 2010.</p></div>\\n<div>\\n<h2>End of life</h2> </div>\\n<div><p>The original iPhone\\'s successor, the iPhone 3G, arrived a year later, adding 3G functionality, apps and more; the first iPhone was discontinued the same week. Apple ultimately declared the first-generation iPhone \"obsolete\" in June 2013, prior to the unveiling of the iPhone 5 and 5S.</p></div>\\n<div><p>A prototype of the first-generation iPhone <a>sold for $1500 on eBay in 2013</a>. \\r</p></div>\\n<div>\\n<h2>Legacy</h2> </div>\\n<div><p>The first iPhone is primarily remembered as the product that set Apple on its current course, as a company in which the iPhone is the product line that both sells the most and is most important to the company\\'s bottom line and financial health. Before it, almost no mobile devices had touchscreens; now, nearly all of them do.</p></div>\\n<div><p>That original iPhone sold just over 6 million in its first year. While current iPhone sales significantly outpace that number, the first iPhone\\'s legacy is secure as one of the most important products in Apple history.</p></div>\\n</div>\\n<div><div><div><a>Follow AppleInsider on Google News</a></div></div></div>\\n<aside><div><div><a>Stephen Silver</a></div></div>\\n<div><div><a><p>Stephen joined AppleInsider in 2018, where he writes about the shows, movies and business of Apple TV+, while also authoring the twice-monthly Apple crime blotter column.</p></a></div></div></aside>\\n</div></article><div><span><a>27 Comments</a></span></div>\\n<div><section><div>\\n<h2>27 Comments</h2>\\n<div><div>\\n<header><a><div>\\n<span>xbit</span><span>391comments· 9 Years</span>\\n</div></a><div><a>About <time>5 years ago</time></a></div></header><div>\\n<p>\"<span>The iPhone was the debut of the touchscreen, which would soon become standard in the category.

In addition, you can easily construct a favorites list for your most frequently made calls, and easily merge calls together to create conference calls.</div>\\n<div>iPhone’s pioneering Visual Voicemail, an industry first, lets users look at a listing of their voicemails, decide which messages to listen to, then go directly to those messages without listening to the prior messages. Just like email, iPhone’s Visual Voicemail enables users to immediately randomly access those messages that interest them most.</div>\\n<div>iPhone includes an SMS application with a full QWERTY soft keyboard to easily send and receive SMS messages in multiple sessions. When users need to type, iPhone presents them with an elegant touch keyboard which is predictive to prevent and correct mistakes, making it much easier and more efficient to use than the small plastic keyboards on many smartphones. iPhone also includes a calendar application that allows calendars to be automatically synced with your PC or Mac.</div>\\n<div>iPhone features a 2 megapixel camera and a photo management application that is far beyond anything on a phone today. Users can browse their photo library, which can be easily synced from their PC or Mac, with just a flick of a finger and easily choose a photo for their wallpaper or to include in an email.</div>\\n<div>iPhone is a quad-band GSM phone which also features EDGE and Wi-Fi wireless technologies for data networking. Apple has chosen Cingular, the best and most popular carrier in the US with over 58 million subscribers, to be Apple’s exclusive carrier partner for iPhone in the US.</div>\\n<div>\\n<b>iPhone is a Widescreen iPod</b>iPhone is a widescreen iPod with touch controls that lets music lovers “touch” their music by easily scrolling through entire lists of songs, artists, albums and playlists with just a flick of a finger. Album artwork is stunningly presented on iPhone’s large and vibrant display.</div>\\n<div>iPhone also features Cover Flow, Apple’s amazing way to browse your music library by album cover artwork, for the first time on an iPod. When navigating your music library on iPhone, you are automatically switched into Cover Flow by simply rotating iPhone into its landscape position.</div>\\n<div>iPhone’s stunning 3.5-inch widescreen display offers the ultimate way to watch TV shows and movies on a pocketable device, with touch controls for play-pause, chapter forward-backward and volume. iPhone plays the same videos purchased from the online iTunes® Store that users enjoy watching on their computers and iPods, and will soon enjoy watching on their widescreen televisions using the new Apple TV™. The iTunes Store now offers over 350 television shows, over 250 feature films and over 5,000 music videos.</div>\\n<div>iPhone lets users enjoy all their iPod content, including music, audiobooks, audio podcasts, video podcasts, music videos, television shows and movies. iPhone syncs content from a user’s iTunes library on their PC or Mac, and can play any music or video content they have purchased from the online iTunes store.</div>\\n<div>\\n<b>iPhone is a Breakthrough Internet Communications Device</b>iPhone features a rich HTML email client which fetches your email in the background from most POP3 or IMAP mail services and displays photos and graphics right along with the text. iPhone is fully multi-tasking, so you can be reading a web page while downloading your email in the background.</div>\\n<div>Yahoo! Mail, the world’s largest email service with over 250 million users, is offering a new free “push” IMAP email service to all iPhone users that automatically pushes new email to a user’s iPhone, and can be set up by simply entering your Yahoo! name and password. iPhone will also work with most industry standard IMAP and POP based email services, such as Microsoft Exchange, Apple .Mac Mail, AOL Mail, Google Gmail and most ISP mail services.</div>\\n<div>iPhone also features the most advanced and fun-to-use web browser on a portable device with a version of its award-winning Safari™ web browser for iPhone. Users can see any web page the way it was designed to be seen, and then easily zoom in to expand any section by simply tapping on iPhone’s multi-touch display with their finger. Users can surf the web from just about anywhere over Wi-Fi or EDGE, and can automatically sync their bookmarks from their PC or Mac. iPhone’s Safari web browser also includes built-in Google Search and Yahoo! Search so users can instantly search for information on their iPhone just like they do on their computer.</div>\\n<div>iPhone also includes Google Maps, featuring Google’s groundbreaking maps service and iPhone’s amazing maps application, offering the best maps experience by far on any pocket device. Users can view maps, satellite images, traffic information and get directions, all from iPhone’s remarkable and easy-to-use touch interface.</div>\\n<div>\\n<b>iPhone’s Advanced Sensors</b>iPhone employs advanced built-in sensors—an accelerometer, a proximity sensor and an ambient light sensor—that automatically enhance the user experience and extend battery life. iPhone’s built-in accelerometer detects when the user has rotated the device from portrait to landscape, then automatically changes the contents of the display accordingly, with users immediately seeing the entire width of a web page, or a photo in its proper landscape aspect ratio.</div>\\n<div>iPhone’s built-in proximity sensor detects when you lift iPhone to your ear and immediately turns off the display to save power and prevent inadvertent touches until iPhone is moved away. iPhone’s built-in ambient light sensor automatically adjusts the display’s brightness to the appropriate level for the current ambient light, thereby enhancing the user experience and saving power at the same time.</div>\\n<div>\\n<b>Pricing &amp; Availability</b>iPhone will be available in the US in June 2007, Europe in late 2007, and Asia in 2008, in a 4GB model for $499 (US) and an 8GB model for $599 (US), and will work with either a PC or Mac. iPhone will be sold in the US through Apple’s retail and online stores, and through Cingular’s retail and online stores. Several iPhone accessories will also be available in June, including Apple’s new remarkably compact Bluetooth headset.</div>\\n<div>iPhone includes support for quad-band GSM, EDGE, 802.11b/g Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 2.0 EDR wireless technologies.</div>\\n<div>iPhone requires a Mac with a USB 2.0 port, Mac OS® X v10.4.8 or later and iTunes 7; or a Windows PC with a USB 2.0 port and Windows 2000 (Service Pack 4), Windows XP Home or Professional (Service Pack 2). Internet access is required and a broadband connection is recommended. Apple and Cingular will announce service plans for iPhone before it begins shipping in June.</div>\\n<div>\\n<b>Learn More About iPhone</b>To learn more about iPhone, please visit Apple.com or watch the video of the iPhone introduction at <a>www.apple.com/iphone/keynote</a>.</div>\\n</div></div>\\n<aside><div><div>Apple ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II and reinvented the personal computer in the 1980s with the Macintosh.
