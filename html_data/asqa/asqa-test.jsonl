Club\", wrote that \"things become sort of uncomfortable\" in the scene in \"Sick\" where Rick chases Andrew into a courtyard full of zombies and locks the door, noting that while Rick does not actually kill Andrew, \"it's a cold, cruel move, and it indicates a growing chill in Rick's character\". Lesley Goldberg of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted that in \"Killer Within\", Rick's decision to lock Andrew out \"amid a sea of walkers came back to bite the group in a major way\". Glen Mazzara felt that this decision would haunt Rick, as Rick \"believed he was committing an act of murder to save the group and that murder led to deaths within his own group and forced his own son to put down his mother\". \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Laura Hudson considered the identity of the mysterious figure breaking open the lock on the prison gates to be \"not that much of a \"mystery\" if you consider how many black guys there are running around outside the prison with vendettas against Rick (note: one)\". Ted Pigeon of\" Slant Magazine\" described the episode's opening sequence: \"With its dreamlike, foggy setting and a conspicuously waist-down perspective of the saboteur, a peculiar sense of disconnect underlines the implications of what's being depicted. The scene ends with a single close-up of a heart placed on the cold cement. It's a foreboding image that gains magnitude as \"Killer Within\" gives way to a sudden strike of tragedy. Moreover, the pre-credit sequence lends insight into how the episode amounts to a particularly poignant, if also problematic, entry in the show's run.\" Pigeon also notes that the opening segments of the episode \"establish the origins for the ensuing chaos while going to painstaking lengths to conceal the identity of the man that caused it\". HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall commented on Andrew's sabotage of the prison: \"on the one hand, it helps justify Rick's decision to chase after the little guy in the first place. On the other, it seemed like an overly-elaborate plan from someone who probably would have been better off just leaving once he managed to get the gate open.\" Bex Schwartz wrote in her review for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine that when Andrew (\"the tiny prisoner\") tries to get Oscar to shoot Rick, \"Oscar shoots Andrew instead, because Oscar understands life and death and remembers that Andrew was one of the bad dudes\". Moore commented on how Andrew died in the series: \" It's weird because I have so much fun playing bad guys and I loved the way Andrew went out! He went out like a G, and he took a few people with him! [...] Die Hard \"TWD\" fans will remember my character forever because of all the trouble he caused. Plus Andrew almost got Rick!

{"qa_pairs": [{"question": "In section one of the dream of the rood what is the rood eventually drenched in beyond the gems?", "short_answers": ["blood"], "context": "The poem is set up with the narrator having a dream. In this dream or vision he is speaking to the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. The poem itself is divided up into three separate sections: the first part (ll. 1–27), the second part (ll. 28–121) and the third part (ll. 122–156). In section one, the narrator has a vision of the Cross. Initially when the dreamer sees the Cross, he notes how it is covered with gems. He is aware of how wretched he is compared to how glorious the tree is. However, he comes to see that amidst the beautiful stones it is stained with blood. In section two, the Cross shares its account of Jesus' death. The Crucifixion story is told from the perspective of the Cross. It begins with the enemy coming to cut the tree down and carrying it away. The tree learns that it is not to be the bearer of a criminal, but instead Christ crucified. The Lord and the Cross become one, and they stand together as victors, refusing to fall, taking on insurmountable pain for the sake of mankind. It is not just Christ, but the Cross as well that is pierced with nails. Adelhied L. J. Thieme remarks, \"The cross itself is portrayed as his lord's retainer whose most outstanding characteristic is that of unwavering loyalty\". The Rood and Christ are one in the portrayal of the Passion—they are both pierced with nails, mocked and tortured. Then, just as with Christ, the Cross is resurrected, and adorned with gold and silver. It is honoured above all trees just as Jesus is honoured above all men. The Cross then charges the visionary to share all that he has seen with others. In section three, the author gives his reflections about this vision. The vision ends, and the man is left with his thoughts. He gives praise to God for what he has seen and is filled with hope for eternal life and his desire to once again be near the glorious Cross.", "wikipage": "Dream of the Rood"}, {"question": "In section two of the dream of the rood what is the rood eventually drenched in?", "short_answers": ["gold and silver"], "context": "No context provided", "wikipage": null}, {"question": "In section one of the dream of the rood what precious items is the rood drenched in?", "short_answers": ["gems"], "context": "No context provided", "wikipage": null}], "wikipages": [{"title": "Dream of the Rood", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream%20of%20the%20Rood"}], "annotations": [{"long_answer": "In section one of the Dream of the Rood, the narrator has a vision of the Cross.

At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus.

Spatial recruitment is the activation of more motor units to produce a greater force. Larger motor units contract along with small motor units until all muscle fibers in a single muscle are activated, thus producing the maximum muscle force. Temporal motor unit recruitment, or rate coding, deals with the frequency of activation of muscle fiber contractions. Consecutive stimulation on the motor unit fibres from the alpha motor neuron causes the muscle to twitch more frequently until the twitches \"fuse\" temporally.

This number will be fewer, but close to the number of days in the summer where the sun doesn't set (for example the sunrise is usually a few days before the spring equinox and extends a few days past the fall equinox). This phenomenon of more daylight than night is not unique to the poles. In fact, at any given time slightly more than half of the earth is in daylight. The 24 hours of summer daylight is known as the midnight sun that is famous in some northern countries. To the north, the Arctic Circle marks this 23.44° boundary. To the south, the Antarctic Circle marks the boundary. These boundaries correspond to 66.56° north or south latitude, respectively. Because the Sun's disc itself is about half a degree in diameter and is very bright, truly dark days during which the sun never seems to rise are only seen beyond 72° north or south latitude.", "wikipage": "Daytime"}, {"question": "4. which southern latitudes experience the greatest annual change in daylight hours?", "short_answers": ["beyond 72°"], "context": "No context provided", "wikipage": null}], "wikipages": [{"title": "Daytime", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime"}], "annotations": [{"long_answer": "On Earth, daytime is the period of the day during which a given location experiences natural illumination from direct sunlight.

Occurring approximately two-thirds into the film, the song assumes a role that was originally occupied by the song \"If I Can't Love Her\" in the Broadway musical, identified by Fred Hawson of \"ABS-CBN News\" as \"a grand moving solo\" during which the Beast sincerely expresses his undying feelings for Belle. In \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Evermore\" appears as a solo performed by the Beast shortly before \"The Mob Song\" as the film approaches its dramatic climax. After the Beast and Belle (Emma Watson) share a dance in the castle's ballroom to Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) singing \"Beauty and the Beast\", the couple has a conversation during which the Beast learns how much Belle actually misses her father, Maurice (Kevin Kline).

Non-pacemaker cells (including the ventricular and atrial cells) have a period, immediately after an action potential, where the membrane potential remains relatively constant; this is known as a resting membrane potential. This resting phase (see cardiac action potential, phase 4) ends when another action potential reaches the cell. This produces a positive change in membrane potential (known as depolarisation), which initiates the start of the next action potential. Pacemaker cells, however, don’t have this resting phase. Instead, immediately after one action potential, the membrane potential of these cells begins to depolarise again automatically, this is known as the pacemaker potential. Once the pacemaker potential reaches a set value, known as the threshold value, it then produces an action potential.

Before James, the record for largest successful Final Jeopardy wager was $34,000 held by Austin Rogers.

In addition to an aggressive wagering strategy, Holzhauer also goes for the highest values on the board first to amass his totals quickly, make it more difficult for his opponents to catch up, and increase the money he has available to wager when he hits a Daily Double. He finally lost on June 3, 2019 to Emma Boettcher, making his 32 wins the second-longest day streak in show history, and his total winnings of $2,462,216 the second most money won in regular-season play. He also has won the third-most money overall in the show as of June 6, 2019, and, counting winnings on all game shows, is third overall after winning the Tournament of Champions in a rematch with Emma. He then went on to participate in the \"Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time\" primetime event , winning one of four matches and finishing second overall behind Ken Jennings.

The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises: the Green Bay Packers (1966–1967), the Miami Dolphins (1972–1973), the Pittsburgh Steelers (1974–1975 and 1978–1979, the only team to accomplish this feat twice and the only team with four wins in six consecutive seasons), the San Francisco 49ers (1988–1989), the Dallas Cowboys (1992–1993), the Denver Broncos (1997–1998), and the New England Patriots (2003–2004). Among those, Dallas (1992–1993; 1995) and New England (2001; 2003–2004) are the only teams to win three out of four consecutive Super Bowls. The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII. The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens, who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position.

The Toyota \"Jeep\" BJ prototype was developed in January 1951. This came from the demand for military-type utility vehicles, much like the British Land Rover Series 1 that was developed in 1948. The Jeep BJ was larger than the original U.S. Jeep and more powerful courtesy of its Type B 3.4-litre six-cylinder OHV Four-stroke petrol engine which generated a power output of at 3,600 rpm and torque at 1,600 rpm. It had a part-time four-wheel drive system like the Jeep. However, and unlike the Jeep, the Jeep BJ had no low-range transfer case. In July 1951, Toyota's test driver Ichiro Taira drove the next generation of the Jeep BJ prototype up to the sixth stage of Mount Fuji, the first vehicle to climb that height. The test was overseen by the National Police Agency (NPA).
